The phone boots fully stable in about 2 mins as apposed to 5-6 mins. My computer also can write to these cards much faster than the 16GB ones I was using. If your phone, tablet or any other device can support it I recommend you purchase these. Also you pay like half the price using Amazon as opposed to other retail stores who\'s price is at least double or more.

Cheaper on Amazon than any other site I found it on and fast shipping. Works great with my phone so far. I\'ve been using this for a little over a week now, no issues at all. The only thing I wish it had is a full size SD adapter instead of the micro USB one, but that\'s not a big deal for me as I already have a few of those lying around. Overall, a great buy!\nAssistant: {""sentiment"":""Strongly Positive"",""explanation"":""""}\n\nUser: I bought this card to increase storage on my Samsung Tab A6 (2017). Initially, it worked without any issues; quick transfer speed and ample space. However, after a few weeks, it began causing my tablet to freeze and restart unexpectedly. Upon troubleshooting, I discovered that the card might be faulty as the problem resolved once I removed it. While the card served its purpose for a short while, its failure led to data loss and device instability.\nAssistant: {""sentiment"":""Strongly Negative"",""explanation"":""""}\n\nUser: This card worked perfectly fine in my Samsung Galaxy S6 for about 9 months without any issues until one day I tried to access it and it was no longer recognized by my phone nor my computer.

"**Update 6.24.14**My 128 GB card stopped allowing writes via any of my card-readers on a Windows PC--either when it was inside any of several full-size SD card adapters (with the write-protect tab in either position) or plugged directly into the microSD slot of the reader.  MicroSD cards have no write-protect tab, so I was quite surprised and worried by this.  After failing to find any workable solution by searching online, I finally put it in my Chromebook and created a new folder on it there, then stuck it back in my Windows PC and it no longer gave me a write-protect error.  If anyone has a similar problem, I'd recommend doing something similar by putting it in any other PC, laptop, camera, etc you have available and try writing to it there.----------------------------------------------This portion of my review is necessarily being written as an update to my original review of the 64 GB version of this card, since Amazon disallows multiple reviews for what they consider the same item.  This portion concerns the 128 GB version of this card:I don't need a fast card, so the speeds on this card were not that important, besides which my test PC is not exactly high-end. Therefore I didn't count off for the speed results I got below, using a USB 2.0 card adapter, but I thought they might be relevant to some readers. While the card did reach the Class-10 and/or UHS-I requirements, it came in at under 2/3 of the claimed ""read speeds up to 30 MB/s for fast file transfer.""  Then again, running on a second PC using a different USB 2.0 card reader, none of the speeds even hit 5 MB/s, so this seems to be highly system-dependent.I only just got the card this week, and so far it works on *select* SDXC-compatible devices and exFAT-compatible operating systems:  some SDXC-compatible devices, such as the Panasonic HDC-TM40, do not allow cards larger than 64 GB (for whatever reason); this was stated in the manual, and I've confirmed this card is recognized as broken/corrupt/unusable in that device, whereas 64 GB exFAT cards work fine.  The 128 GB works fine (with original exFAT formatting) in my Toshiba Excite 7.7 Android tablet, and (predictably) not at all in my non-SDXC-compatible Galaxy Note 2 (though it possibly would if reformatted to FAT32, since a 64 GB card in FAT32 works fine there).I'll update my review to reflect any problems, issues, etc that I notice in the coming days & weeks.-----------------------------------------------------------------------CrystalDiskMark 3.0.3 (C) 2007-2013 hiyohiyoCrystal Dew World : [url removed as per Amazon rules]-----------------------------------------------------------------------* MB/s = 1,000,000 byte/s [SATA/300 = 300,000,000 byte/s]Sequential Read : 18.694 MB/sSequential Write : 11.921 MB/sRandom Read 512KB : 18.502 MB/sRandom Write 512KB : 0.680 MB/sRandom Read 4KB (QD=1) : 3.339 MB/s [ 815.1 IOPS]Random Write 4KB (QD=1) : 1.581 MB/s [ 386.1 IOPS]Random Read 4KB (QD=32) : 3.151 MB/s [ 769.4 IOPS]Random Write 4KB (QD=32) : 1.564 MB/s [ 381.8 IOPS]Test : 1000 MB [G: 0.0% (0.0/119.1 GB)] (x5)Date : 2014/04/24 16:53:49OS : Windows XP Professional SP3 [5.1 Build 2600] (x86)-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The following is my original review of the 64 GB version of this card, published April 24, 2013:This is a high-quality card.  I've used it in a variety of devices, through multiple readers on different pcs, in an HD camcorder using a micro to full-sized SD adapter, and I've never once had a problem with it.  It even works at full capacity in *some* microSDHC-only devices once its reformatted to FAT32 (such as my SanDisk Clip+ FLAC player and supposedly even PSPs via a proper adapter, though I haven't yet tested my PSP).

"I'm amazed.  I ordered this from Amazon on Tuesday morning, and it arrived with Wednesday's mail.  VERY impressive service from Amazon!As has already been reported, the card formats out to > 59 Gb, and it performs perfectly in my Samsung Galaxy S III (which is also new).  Using two card readers on a fast PC, I transferred everything from my old 16GB card to the new 64 GB card in less time than it took to walk to the kitchen and get a cup of coffee.  So I think the Class 10 rating is correct on the card.Once I have some experience with the card in the phone, I'll benchmark the card and I'll also benchmark operations such as internally backing up my Android phone to the card.  Then I'll update this review with some accurate numerical data.  But in the mean time on first look, the person who said that the S 3 has problems with anything faster than class 6 may not have been correct - a full backup of the phone to the card was significantly faster than the backup with the old 16GB class 6 card.  Again no benchmarks yet but once I have them I'll include them here.Right now I'm very happy with this card and I'm really impressed - both with the card and with the unbelievably quick service from Amazon (and I'm in Atlanta where shipments like this one often take the full 3 days to arrive).",Strongly Positive,Positive,"{'content': '{\n  ""sentiment"": ""Strongly Positive"",\n  ""explanation"": ""The review expresses strong satisfaction and amazement with both the storage card\'s performance and the impressively swift delivery from Amazon.

"I bought 64GB version of the card to use with GoPro Hero 3 black edition.  It didn't work out.  The card worked OK if camera was set to resolution with lower bit rates.  E.g. worked fine in 720p with protune on, or 1080p with protune off.  However, in 1080p with protune on (bitrate is just shy of 6 MB/s in this mode -- much higher then with protune turned off) it was nothing but trouble.  Camera would sometime work, and sometime randomly stop recording for no obvious reason.  I first suspected camera, but testing with different SD cards, it ended up being SanDisk's card that was at fault.  My spare card, an old and cheap 16GB PNY (also class 10), worked just fine under same conditions and with same camera settings.Once it was obvious it was problem with the card, I found people on GoPro's forums that had trouble with this specific card as well (well, you always find these only after you figure it out for yourself, right?).  Anyhow, I did some speed tests with the card by doing simple write of 1GB file full of zeros using Unix dd utility to copy 1GB of zeros from /dev/zero (where else would you find that many zeros ;-) onto a file on the card.  The result was that on average, SanDisk's card would manage about 10.2 MB/s.  Just barely above the bar for class 10 card.  However, that was average over 1GB.  During the write test, the speed was oscillating with many spikes and drops.  Drops were as low as 7MB/s.  Uh.  I thought write speed of class 10 card should never dip below 10 MB/s?  For comparison, my old cheap class 10 PNY card was chugging along at constant 13 MB/s under the same test.  No spikes and no drops in speed.The card will probably work fine in most devices, as bitrates when recording 1080p video are often low enough and/or camera might have huge buffer.  But if you want to use it to record video at high bitrates, and your device doesn't have huge buffer to compensate for speed bumps of this card, you may run into trouble.  Be wary of using it in Hero3 in modes that have higher bit rates (e.g. 1080p with protune enabled).SanDisk's website lists part numbers as SDSDQUI-064G with adapter, and SDSDQUA-064G without adapter.  This conflicts with product description on Amazon.  While this is likely just Amazon not getting product description right again (a bit too common thing), it's interesting to note.[Update Apr 20 2013]:Some numbers from testing the card.  The test is extremely simple.  Write out 1GB of zeros onto the card using standard Unix dd command to read 128KB blocks of zeroes from special device /dev/zero and write it onto the card.  128KB * 8192 = 1GB.  dd displays transfer stats once it finishes.  While dd was running, I run iostat in second terminal displaying 1 second interval stats as a measure of current speed.  This was done on the Mac.  dd command line can be used as-is to repeat test on Linux system, however iostat command is different on Linux and would need to be modified slightly.  I choose 128KB block size, as that seems to be what device drivers merges sequential writes into anyhow.  Using different block sizes, results are comparable.$ dd if=/dev/zero of=test bs=131072 count=81928192+0 records in8192+0 records out1073741824 bytes transferred in 101.578307 secs (10570582 bytes/sec)So, 10 MB/s and all is good? Right? Wrong! iostat running in parallel with above dd command recorded this and so on until dd finishes writing 1GB of zeros to the card ... ]IMO, the last column should never dip under 10MB/s for card labeled class-10.For comparison, same test run against Samsung Pro 64GB micro-SD card:$ dd if=/dev/zero of=test bs=131072 count=81928192+0 records in8192+0 records out1073741824 bytes transferred in 52.869111 secs (20309436 bytes/sec) and so on until dd finishes writing 1GB of zeros to the card ... ]So, Samsung is on average 2x faster, but more importantly it's speed is much more constant.  And critically important, it never dips under 10MB/s.",Strongly Negative,Negative,"{'content': '{\n  ""sentiment"": ""Negative"",\n  ""explanation"": ""The user expresses dissatisfaction with the SanDisk 64GB microSD card\'s performance, particularly when used with a GoPro Hero 3 Black Edition for recording high-resolution video (1080p) with H.264 (fast-motion) Compression (protune on).

It seems that, upon close inspection, the SanDisk card shows signs of struggle with the video stream being more demanding; at least it does if you consider the difference between SanDisk and N-itake (other factor).\nGiven these variables, one observes subtle tension, though likely unfounded: had you used 64GB version, a class of card is intended for GoPro Hero, indicating some sort of struggle with SanDisk in this scenario.""\n}', 'retries': 0}","{'content': '{""sentiment"":""Negative...Strongly Negative"", ""explanation"":"">"" SanDisk\'s website lists part numbers as 45344 as SandQ 4612 (SD-QR 4612).

"My Samsung Galaxy Note 2 came with 8 gigs of internal memory. I discovered that apps can only be written to the internal 8 gigs of memory so I didn't want to fill up the internal memory with pictures, videos, music, etc.  I purchased the 64 GB San Disk Ultra MicroSDXC Class 10 card. I found a video on youtube to learn how to insert the card since I could find nothing on it in the phone's user guide.  It's real easy. Turn the Note phone off. Remove the Note's back plate. You see a plaque saying SD card in the upper left quadrant of the phone. Simply place the microsd card face up with the metallic pins facing down and towards the right into the depressed slot area to the left of the SD card plaque. Then slowly and gently slide the microsd card under the plaque until it clicks. If it isn't in correctly, it will tend to move back out from under the plaque. Do not force. Replace the back plate on the phone. Turn the phone on.  Go to settings, storage.  At the bottom of the page, you will see SD Card.  If the microsd card was inserted correctly, you will see the additional GBs of storage displayed there.  You will also see Reformat SD card and Remove SD card.  Use these settings to erase data from the microsd card, and to remove it from the phone.  Do not try to remove the microsd card from the phone without first activating the Remove SD Card setting.  You can damage the card and the phone.  The card came quickly and San Disk is a reliable brand. It's great to have the Class 10 rating too.",Positive,Positive,"{'content': '{\n  ""sentiment"": ""Positive"",\n  ""explanation"": ""The text is largely positive as it describes a clear, step-by-step process for adding an SD card to a Samsung Galaxy Note 2, emphasizing the reliability of both the SD card brand (San Disk) and the device (Samsung).

"I will keep it short and sweet for potential buyers looking for facts and not b.s.I own two of the 32gb size of these cards for about 3 months now. They do work fairly well with cell phones and tablets, yet not so good with cameras, in fact these cards failed to work with my GoPro Hero3 camera and the customer service rep from Gopro claimed (and I happen to agree with him) that this card is not a true class 10 card let alone UHS-1.Benchmarks with my evo 4g with all allocation sizes the write speed never passed beyond 8mb/s while read speeds wondered around 25mb/s far below advertised speeds, well write speeds arent technically advertised (probably because they are of class 4 level)Benchmarks with crystal mark reported speeds even lower (due to adapter) with write speeds around 6mb/s while read speeds wondered around 20mb/s.Needless to say, if you are not worried about speeds and only about storage, these are perfect. If you want to use them for shooting high definition raw footage however, I suggest you not to loose your money on this, because even if your write speeds are around 10mb/s as the card begins to decay it will slow down to become useless.Again this review is based on GoPro camera and high definition raw recording..

I'm not sure what else I can say other than that I have no problems with it and it hasn't died on my yet.It's been about 4 months at least now in my Samsung Galaxy S3. The S3 had a reputation for breaking sandisk sd cards for some reason and it's only randomly unmounted about 3 times but easily remounted with a take out and put back in with maybe a restart on the phone to refresh some apps to see it. I think this is just because the Galaxy S3 tends to get really hot right below the sd card which might damage it a bit.

"Bought this card to use with my Samsung Galaxy Tab2 7in tablet, based on others who have reported getting it to work in their Galaxy Tab 2.Bottom line, you gotta reformat this card as FAT32 with 32kb sectors to work in the Galaxy Tab 2, and that requires jumping thru some hoops as Win6/Vista does not even offer the choice to format as FAT32, only as NTFS or exFAT, neither of which will work with the Galaxy Tab 2 (Android v4.04)  You have to use 3rd party software to accomplish this.

"If your card gets hot enough to be painful, it is defective and you need to contact SanDisk!From my experience, the larger micro SDs run hot on format and writing, but not to the pain threshold!I purchased one of these cards to use in a camera and Android tablet.  Great read speed but write speed was okay.  Used card for about two weeks and then all my files disappeared!  Tried to format the card and three different computers with XP, Windows, and Linux couldn't format it.  The camera and tablet couldn't format it.  I RMA'd it and got another because SanDisk is a good brand.  I did notice that when formatting or writing the card it got hot, very hot.Second card didn't last 24 hours and had the exact same symptoms as the first card.  Write a file or format it resulted in the card getting hot enough to reach the pain threshold.  I called up SanDisk and while explaining this was the second card I'd received with the exact same symptoms, when I mentioned it getting hot, they immediately issued me an RMA.  They said they were told to issue an RMA the moment they heard a card ran hot.Smaller SanDisk micro SD's or regular SD's I have or use don't do this.

"It is so hard to imagine that you can have 32 GB is something smaller than a postage stamp, yet here it is.I bought this card to work with my Call of Duty Ghosts Tactical Camera and it works perfectly.  The camera came with a 4 G card which I filled in just over an hour at the local Kart track.  I missed the last bit of our race due to insufficient capacity.  The battery was still going strong so I needed more card for recording my adventures.This card fits the bill nicely.As a UHS Speed Class 1 (roughly equiv Class 10) card this SD card is quite capable of any photographic or video need up to Full HD (not 2k or 4k).

It means that you should have no trouble recording HD video reliably with this card.  Your camera will be able to save pictures quickly to this card so it is ready to take the next shot.

"Bought 2 of these for the wife's & my Android phone. When her's failed after 2 months, we figured it was just luck of the draw. Now mine failed after just over 4 months, losing a bunch of photos & videos (I made sure to back up every few weeks but even so, we just lost a bunch of photos of our 2 month newborn).Clearly SanDisk had a bad batch with this lot and as the return policy is horrible, I won't be buying any more SanDisk, no matter how cheap (when we bought them on sale around January 2013 they were over half the price of similar SD cards; again, SanDisk clearly knew they had a bad batch, shame on them for dumping them on the customer, no matter how cheap).While I would presumed they would have solved the problem in production, buy at your own risk, SanDisk will sell product with ridiculous failure rate.EDIT: After submitting my review I did some more research on other sites and the low star reviews here. SanDisk is so clearly guilty of selling a defective product from the batch about 6 months ago. Which as I said before, is when they put them on a super discount sale. They knew what they were doing and they are thumbing their nose at customers who just fell outside warrantee (like myself).To knowingly sell your customer something that is going to fail at an unacceptable rate and then ignore them because it failed a little bit outside warrantee is just bad faith. I beg people considering buying this product to not do so, and thumb up the reviews warning of failures. It is only when companies lose sales do they reconsider not screwing their customers like this.Personally I have bought several SanDisk thumb drives, CompactFlash cards, and a Sandisk MP3 player.

"Before purchasing this I had a SanDisk 16GB Class 2 microSDHC. Needless to say, I didn't see the need in purchasing one of these. Then I began to read how Class 10 cards really do process recordings faster and records pictures faster. I didn't believe it, so I put it to the test. Using it in my Samsung Galaxy sIII, I installed it and recorded videos, took pictures, and played music on it. I also downloaded PDFs for work and other documents to it.

"Of late, Sandisk appears to have lost their way a little with their flash storage products. It's almost a universal truth that all of their USB flash drives are hopelessly slow; while they're usually reliable, transfer rates of 4MB/sec or less are worthless when filling a 32GB drive. Fortunately, their ""Ultra"" line of SD cards still appears to buck this trend.Formatted as NTFS and used in anelago Mobile Nano II reader, I see write speeds on a 64-bit Linux machine at a consistent 15-16MB/sec when copying large (1GB or larger) files to this card, which more than lives up to its class 10 billing. Reads appear to run at about 19-20MB/sec.I can't comment on reliability as I've only had the card a few days, but everything I've copied so far for testing has made it onto the card (and off again) with no corruption whatsoever; the MD5 checksum of every file I've transferred matches the source. That's more than can be said for the Supertalent Pico USB drive that this SD card and reader are intended to replace, which has never been quite right (it's always occasionally randomly corrupted files of larger than 100MB or so, and the probability of 1GB or greater files surviving was near zero).32GB appears to be the sweet spot at the moment; smaller cards don't cost that much less, and larger cards are beyond the SDHC spec and into SDXC territory, which isn't yet universal in terms of device compatibility (not to mention they cost far more than double for 64GB).For what I paid for this around Thanksgiving (not part of any explicit sale, but definitely a lower price than appears usual as far as camelcamelcamel is concerned) I'm extremely satisfied.Edit: I should also mention that the included mechanical full-size SD adaptor is one of the worst I've ever encountered. There's a lot of friction when the microSD card is inserted, and it's a right bugger to get it out of the adaptor again.

"I bought this card because I have several devices that use microSD cards, but not all of them are compatible with the newer and higher-capacity SDXC standard.

"I guess I should be happy it failed after only 1 month, because I only lost 1 month's worth of pictures etc.  I bought 3 of these cards for my wife, son and I.

No a reboot caused my Motorola Defy XT to tell me the card was blank and needed to be formatted.  My laptop won't even recognize the card when I put the card in it's reader.  After a couple hours of looking for a way to fix it, I have only found that this is very common for this specific card.EDIT: I was very happy with Sandisk after calling them.  They did say there are compatibility issues with CLASS 10 cards and some of the Android phones, and verified my phone is one of them.  They offered free replacement with a card that would be certain not to have the same issue mine just had, and also to attempt recovery of my items from the card.

"I purchased this Ultra MicroSDHC Class 10 card for my media player. I wanted to replace my 4GB cardwith this one so I could store more music. I like to have a wide range of music to pick from when I amon vacation or traveling on an airplane long distances. I think I may have bought too much.This card is advertised as water-proof, temperature proof, X-ray proof and shock proof. I will have totake their word for it. I am not going to test it.Just for fun I put the 16GB MicroSDHC disc (30MB/s Read Speed) into its provided adapter and used itin my cheapo cheapo Toshiba Camileo HD movie camera. Even at the Full High Definition resolution of1080p/30fps this disc performed very well. No stuttering, no missed frames and all this under low lightconditions. Nice. Very Nice. Those are big files at Full HD resolution. Read on...This card is 'USH-1' enabled which means it is the fastest card available (allegedly) and should reachup to a bus interface speed of 104 MB/s; if the electronic device you are using requires it. Of courseif your card reader or device does not support that speed you will be transferring data at your usualspeed. Sort of like saying it is backward compatible but don't expect blazing speeds. You can feeddata through only so fast.Transferring RAW photos and a Full HD digital film can take a lot of time to transfer. Those are hugefiles to transfer so the USH-I enabled disc is perfect for that purpose. They are working on USH-IIwhich is supposed to allow up to 300MB/s transfers.

Probably, but for the price it was a terrific deal to get a Class 10USH-1 enabled card and have the flexibility to use it in a variety of my electronic devices. Hmm.

"I bought 4 of these units (yes, at Amazon):  SanDisk Ultra 32 GB microSDHC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card 30MB/s with Adapter SDSDQUA-032G-U46A for 3 Samsung Galaxy SIII and one Samsung Note 2, and found that one in the SGIII has stopped working.

I should not expect anything back, but who knows.For $6 more I have another unit, and I can tell you it will not be a SanDisk Ultra. Oh, well, the average price for the 3 remaining units will then be $34 (33% more than the purchase price).If I get a replacement, I will update this message.Update:I got an e-mail from SanDisk to advise me that they did receive the item and it is being processed. Shipping without tracking cost me $0.65 vs. $20. At least I have to give their customer service (or return department?) credit for being honest.

"I for one have not bought into Google's, or anybody else's, idea that streaming everything is so great.  With all the regressive data caps and sketchy throughput, I never want to rely on something being available to me online.  Much better to have it local.  And with this new card I can finally pack all of my music (~56GB), all of my photos, dozens of reference ebooks, and a few videos to boot and still I have around 9GB free as breathing room for my podcatcher.

"I was out of space on my Droid RAZR 16GB and still had an empty microSD slot, so I figured I'd pick this up seeing as how it is a reputable brand in flash memory. I am glad I went with the Sandisk Ultra, because there is seemingly no difference in speed between this drive and the built-in internal memory of my phone. I record a lot of videos with my phone and I've been recording straight to this card in HD with no problems at all.Installation was a breeze. I took the memory card out of the package and inserted into my phone. Then my phone brought up a menu asking if I wanted to move my music, videos, and photos to the memory card. I selected all three categories, and in minutes it had moved all of my media onto the memory card. I didn't even have to do anything else. I had read some other reviews that said they had to reformat the card or mess around with moving files by hand, but I didn't have to do any of that.I haven't tried using the included SD adapter yet, but I imagine it will work as well as any other adapter. The adapter and memory card were both shipped in a little clear plastic case, which makes it easier to carry the adapter around with you. So you have it with you when you need it.The price on this card when I bought it was a few dollars more than the generic brands. I decided to spend a few extra dollars on it since I would be really upset if I lost all my photos and videos due to a corrupt memory card.

"This is one of the better reviewed SDHC Class 10 cards that utilized UHS. By reading the reviews you will see that it reads/writes at a better speed than many or most cards out there right now. Much depends on your phone, how your phone's OS stores information on a card and what's inside your device. For MOST of us; you probably will not notice anything different between this card and any other GOOD quality card out there. I usually pick the fastest cards on the market when the prices drop. The main problem, speed related is when you transfer large amounts of data (usually music) onto any card. If you use a standard USB 2 connection this card won't speed that process up. If you use a USB 3 or if you actually put this card into a USB 3 reader to do the transfer; then you'll see a nice boost.
