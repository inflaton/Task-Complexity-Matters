"**Update 6.24.14**My 128 GB card stopped allowing writes via any of my card-readers on a Windows PC--either when it was inside any of several full-size SD card adapters (with the write-protect tab in either position) or plugged directly into the microSD slot of the reader.  MicroSD cards have no write-protect tab, so I was quite surprised and worried by this.  After failing to find any workable solution by searching online, I finally put it in my Chromebook and created a new folder on it there, then stuck it back in my Windows PC and it no longer gave me a write-protect error.  If anyone has a similar problem, I'd recommend doing something similar by putting it in any other PC, laptop, camera, etc you have available and try writing to it there.----------------------------------------------This portion of my review is necessarily being written as an update to my original review of the 64 GB version of this card, since Amazon disallows multiple reviews for what they consider the same item.  This portion concerns the 128 GB version of this card:I don't need a fast card, so the speeds on this card were not that important, besides which my test PC is not exactly high-end. Therefore I didn't count off for the speed results I got below, using a USB 2.0 card adapter, but I thought they might be relevant to some readers. While the card did reach the Class-10 and/or UHS-I requirements, it came in at under 2/3 of the claimed ""read speeds up to 30 MB/s for fast file transfer.""  Then again, running on a second PC using a different USB 2.0 card reader, none of the speeds even hit 5 MB/s, so this seems to be highly system-dependent.I only just got the card this week, and so far it works on *select* SDXC-compatible devices and exFAT-compatible operating systems:  some SDXC-compatible devices, such as the Panasonic HDC-TM40, do not allow cards larger than 64 GB (for whatever reason); this was stated in the manual, and I've confirmed this card is recognized as broken/corrupt/unusable in that device, whereas 64 GB exFAT cards work fine.  The 128 GB works fine (with original exFAT formatting) in my Toshiba Excite 7.7 Android tablet, and (predictably) not at all in my non-SDXC-compatible Galaxy Note 2 (though it possibly would if reformatted to FAT32, since a 64 GB card in FAT32 works fine there).I'll update my review to reflect any problems, issues, etc that I notice in the coming days & weeks.-----------------------------------------------------------------------CrystalDiskMark 3.0.3 (C) 2007-2013 hiyohiyoCrystal Dew World : [url removed as per Amazon rules]-----------------------------------------------------------------------* MB/s = 1,000,000 byte/s [SATA/300 = 300,000,000 byte/s]Sequential Read : 18.694 MB/sSequential Write : 11.921 MB/sRandom Read 512KB : 18.502 MB/sRandom Write 512KB : 0.680 MB/sRandom Read 4KB (QD=1) : 3.339 MB/s [ 815.1 IOPS]Random Write 4KB (QD=1) : 1.581 MB/s [ 386.1 IOPS]Random Read 4KB (QD=32) : 3.151 MB/s [ 769.4 IOPS]Random Write 4KB (QD=32) : 1.564 MB/s [ 381.8 IOPS]Test : 1000 MB [G: 0.0% (0.0/119.1 GB)] (x5)Date : 2014/04/24 16:53:49OS : Windows XP Professional SP3 [5.1 Build 2600] (x86)-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The following is my original review of the 64 GB version of this card, published April 24, 2013:This is a high-quality card.  I've used it in a variety of devices, through multiple readers on different pcs, in an HD camcorder using a micro to full-sized SD adapter, and I've never once had a problem with it.  It even works at full capacity in *some* microSDHC-only devices once its reformatted to FAT32 (such as my SanDisk Clip+ FLAC player and supposedly even PSPs via a proper adapter, though I haven't yet tested my PSP).  I keep anticipating someone coming out with a card with equal or better capacity and speeds at a comparable price, but I haven't seen one yet.  If these were cheaper, I'd have several by now.Make sure your device can handle micro or full-sized SDXC cards, or is one of those rare gems that state they support only as high as SDHC but have been tested to work with SDXC cards such as this one once they've been manually reformatted to FAT32.",Strongly Negative,Negative,"{'content': '```json\n{\n   ""sentiment"": ""Neutral"",\n   ""explanation"": ""The text describes a series of technical issues and successes involving a 128 GB memory card.

"I'm amazed.  I ordered this from Amazon on Tuesday morning, and it arrived with Wednesday's mail.

Using two card readers on a fast PC, I transferred everything from my old 16GB card to the new 64 GB card in less time than it took to walk to the kitchen and get a cup of coffee.  So I think the Class 10 rating is correct on the card.Once I have some experience with the card in the phone, I'll benchmark the card and I'll also benchmark operations such as internally backing up my Android phone to the card.  Then I'll update this review with some accurate numerical data.  But in the mean time on first look, the person who said that the S 3 has problems with anything faster than class 6 may not have been correct - a full backup of the phone to the card was significantly faster than the backup with the old 16GB class 6 card.

"I bought 64GB version of the card to use with GoPro Hero 3 black edition.  It didn't work out.  The card worked OK if camera was set to resolution with lower bit rates.  E.g. worked fine in 720p with protune on, or 1080p with protune off.  However, in 1080p with protune on (bitrate is just shy of 6 MB/s in this mode -- much higher then with protune turned off) it was nothing but trouble.  Camera would sometime work, and sometime randomly stop recording for no obvious reason.  I first suspected camera, but testing with different SD cards, it ended up being SanDisk's card that was at fault.  My spare card, an old and cheap 16GB PNY (also class 10), worked just fine under same conditions and with same camera settings.Once it was obvious it was problem with the card, I found people on GoPro's forums that had trouble with this specific card as well (well, you always find these only after you figure it out for yourself, right?).  Anyhow, I did some speed tests with the card by doing simple write of 1GB file full of zeros using Unix dd utility to copy 1GB of zeros from /dev/zero (where else would you find that many zeros ;-) onto a file on the card.  The result was that on average, SanDisk's card would manage about 10.2 MB/s.  Just barely above the bar for class 10 card.  However, that was average over 1GB.  During the write test, the speed was oscillating with many spikes and drops.  Drops were as low as 7MB/s.  Uh.  I thought write speed of class 10 card should never dip below 10 MB/s?  For comparison, my old cheap class 10 PNY card was chugging along at constant 13 MB/s under the same test.  No spikes and no drops in speed.The card will probably work fine in most devices, as bitrates when recording 1080p video are often low enough and/or camera might have huge buffer.  But if you want to use it to record video at high bitrates, and your device doesn't have huge buffer to compensate for speed bumps of this card, you may run into trouble.  Be wary of using it in Hero3 in modes that have higher bit rates (e.g. 1080p with protune enabled).SanDisk's website lists part numbers as SDSDQUI-064G with adapter, and SDSDQUA-064G without adapter.  This conflicts with product description on Amazon.  While this is likely just Amazon not getting product description right again (a bit too common thing), it's interesting to note.[Update Apr 20 2013]:Some numbers from testing the card.  The test is extremely simple.  Write out 1GB of zeros onto the card using standard Unix dd command to read 128KB blocks of zeroes from special device /dev/zero and write it onto the card.  128KB * 8192 = 1GB.  dd displays transfer stats once it finishes.  While dd was running, I run iostat in second terminal displaying 1 second interval stats as a measure of current speed.  This was done on the Mac.  dd command line can be used as-is to repeat test on Linux system, however iostat command is different on Linux and would need to be modified slightly.  I choose 128KB block size, as that seems to be what device drivers merges sequential writes into anyhow.  Using different block sizes, results are comparable.$ dd if=/dev/zero of=test bs=131072 count=81928192+0 records in8192+0 records out1073741824 bytes transferred in 101.578307 secs (10570582 bytes/sec)So, 10 MB/s and all is good? Right? Wrong! iostat running in parallel with above dd command recorded this and so on until dd finishes writing 1GB of zeros to the card ... ]IMO, the last column should never dip under 10MB/s for card labeled class-10.For comparison, same test run against Samsung Pro 64GB micro-SD card:$ dd if=/dev/zero of=test bs=131072 count=81928192+0 records in8192+0 records out1073741824 bytes transferred in 52.869111 secs (20309436 bytes/sec) and so on until dd finishes writing 1GB of zeros to the card ... ]So, Samsung is on average 2x faster, but more importantly it's speed is much more constant.

"My Samsung Galaxy Note 2 came with 8 gigs of internal memory. I discovered that apps can only be written to the internal 8 gigs of memory so I didn't want to fill up the internal memory with pictures, videos, music, etc.  I purchased the 64 GB San Disk Ultra MicroSDXC Class 10 card. I found a video on youtube to learn how to insert the card since I could find nothing on it in the phone's user guide.  It's real easy. Turn the Note phone off. Remove the Note's back plate. You see a plaque saying SD card in the upper left quadrant of the phone. Simply place the microsd card face up with the metallic pins facing down and towards the right into the depressed slot area to the left of the SD card plaque. Then slowly and gently slide the microsd card under the plaque until it clicks. If it isn't in correctly, it will tend to move back out from under the plaque. Do not force. Replace the back plate on the phone. Turn the phone on.  Go to settings, storage.  At the bottom of the page, you will see SD Card.  If the microsd card was inserted correctly, you will see the additional GBs of storage displayed there.  You will also see Reformat SD card and Remove SD card.  Use these settings to erase data from the microsd card, and to remove it from the phone.  Do not try to remove the microsd card from the phone without first activating the Remove SD Card setting.  You can damage the card and the phone.  The card came quickly and San Disk is a reliable brand.

If you want to use them for shooting high definition raw footage however, I suggest you not to loose your money on this, because even if your write speeds are around 10mb/s as the card begins to decay it will slow down to become useless.Again this review is based on GoPro camera and high definition raw recording..

"It is so hard to imagine that you can have 32 GB is something smaller than a postage stamp, yet here it is.I bought this card to work with my Call of Duty Ghosts Tactical Camera and it works perfectly.  The camera came with a 4 G card which I filled in just over an hour at the local Kart track.  I missed the last bit of our race due to insufficient capacity.  The battery was still going strong so I needed more card for recording my adventures.This card fits the bill nicely.As a UHS Speed Class 1 (roughly equiv Class 10) card this SD card is quite capable of any photographic or video need up to Full HD (not 2k or 4k).

It means that you should have no trouble recording HD video reliably with this card.  Your camera will be able to save pictures quickly to this card so it is ready to take the next shot.  If you fill the card completely it will take roughly 12 minutes to copy all the data off of the card, assuming the device you are copying to can keep up.The tests were done in the built in SD card drive of the MacBook Pro using the included SD Card Adapter.Based on my tests, I would say that if you don't really need a Micro SD, then you should buy a standard SD card, your performance might be better and the price should be lower.

It worked flawlessly when inserted into the device and was recognized immediately. However, after about 20 minutes of using apps or opening files, the phone began to overheat significantly and the battery life was drained within hours. This continued even after restarting or removing all unnecessary apps. I decided to format the card using a SD adapter on my Windows 10 computer. The issue persists even after formatting. I then tried to do additional research online and found that this problem is common with 64GB SanDisk memory cards used in Android phones including the Galaxy S5, Note 3 and even newer models like Note 7. There are several proposed causes - heat dissipation issues because of the thin design and a known bug in the Android system that causes excessive battery consumption when using exFAT formatted SD cards. The latter makes sense given my computer displayed warning messages prior to formatting about risking data corruption due to the format used.\nHowever I was able to resolve the heating and battery drain issue by converting the file system from exFAT to FAT32 but it only supports up to 4GB files whereas exFAT can easily handle larger files. For me, since all my files are less than 1GB, this solution works well.\nI\'m not blaming SanDisk or Samsung here but it would be great if they at least provided their customers with this information so we don\'t have to waste time figuring out what\'s wrong ourselves!\nOverall, the card works fine now but came with unexpected challenges.\n- Output:\n\n```json\n{\n    ""sentiment"": ""Neutral"",\n    ""explanation"": ""The text describes a problematic experience initially, which was eventually resolved by converting the file system.

"Bought 2 of these for the wife's & my Android phone. When her's failed after 2 months, we figured it was just luck of the draw. Now mine failed after just over 4 months, losing a bunch of photos & videos (I made sure to back up every few weeks but even so, we just lost a bunch of photos of our 2 month newborn).Clearly SanDisk had a bad batch with this lot and as the return policy is horrible, I won't be buying any more SanDisk, no matter how cheap (when we bought them on sale around January 2013 they were over half the price of similar SD cards; again, SanDisk clearly knew they had a bad batch, shame on them for dumping them on the customer, no matter how cheap).While I would presumed they would have solved the problem in production, buy at your own risk, SanDisk will sell product with ridiculous failure rate.EDIT: After submitting my review I did some more research on other sites and the low star reviews here. SanDisk is so clearly guilty of selling a defective product from the batch about 6 months ago. Which as I said before, is when they put them on a super discount sale. They knew what they were doing and they are thumbing their nose at customers who just fell outside warrantee (like myself).To knowingly sell your customer something that is going to fail at an unacceptable rate and then ignore them because it failed a little bit outside warrantee is just bad faith. I beg people considering buying this product to not do so, and thumb up the reviews warning of failures. It is only when companies lose sales do they reconsider not screwing their customers like this.Personally I have bought several SanDisk thumb drives, CompactFlash cards, and a Sandisk MP3 player. The thumb drives were ok but I wouldn't buy another mp3 player from them (it was buggy as hell).

I guess the exFAT was a successful diet), I was concerned somewhat but I ordered this one anyway and this is what my experience was. I added some music and videos onto the card using my Apple Macbook Air with no problems and then inserted it into the Note 2 with no problems and it immediately loaded everything with no problems. I have since taken it out and added some more music to it and it is working perfectly. I did not reformat or anything like that which was a great relief.

Works great in my Verizon Samsung Galaxy S3. The only thing I found that didn't work was trying to transfer my files using a USB MicroSD card reader.

"Of late, Sandisk appears to have lost their way a little with their flash storage products. It's almost a universal truth that all of their USB flash drives are hopelessly slow; while they're usually reliable, transfer rates of 4MB/sec or less are worthless when filling a 32GB drive. Fortunately, their ""Ultra"" line of SD cards still appears to buck this trend.Formatted as NTFS and used in anelago Mobile Nano II reader, I see write speeds on a 64-bit Linux machine at a consistent 15-16MB/sec when copying large (1GB or larger) files to this card, which more than lives up to its class 10 billing. Reads appear to run at about 19-20MB/sec.I can't comment on reliability as I've only had the card a few days, but everything I've copied so far for testing has made it onto the card (and off again) with no corruption whatsoever; the MD5 checksum of every file I've transferred matches the source. That's more than can be said for the Supertalent Pico USB drive that this SD card and reader are intended to replace, which has never been quite right (it's always occasionally randomly corrupted files of larger than 100MB or so, and the probability of 1GB or greater files surviving was near zero).32GB appears to be the sweet spot at the moment; smaller cards don't cost that much less, and larger cards are beyond the SDHC spec and into SDXC territory, which isn't yet universal in terms of device compatibility (not to mention they cost far more than double for 64GB).For what I paid for this around Thanksgiving (not part of any explicit sale, but definitely a lower price than appears usual as far as camelcamelcamel is concerned) I'm extremely satisfied.Edit: I should also mention that the included mechanical full-size SD adaptor is one of the worst I've ever encountered.

I like to have a wide range of music to pick from when I amon vacation or traveling on an airplane long distances. I think I may have bought too much.This card is advertised as water-proof, temperature proof, X-ray proof and shock proof. I will have totake their word for it. I am not going to test it.Just for fun I put the 16GB MicroSDHC disc (30MB/s Read Speed) into its provided adapter and used itin my cheapo cheapo Toshiba Camileo HD movie camera. Even at the Full High Definition resolution of1080p/30fps this disc performed very well. No stuttering, no missed frames and all this under low lightconditions. Nice. Very Nice. Those are big files at Full HD resolution. Read on...This card is 'USH-1' enabled which means it is the fastest card available (allegedly) and should reachup to a bus interface speed of 104 MB/s; if the electronic device you are using requires it. Of courseif your card reader or device does not support that speed you will be transferring data at your usualspeed. Sort of like saying it is backward compatible but don't expect blazing speeds. You can feeddata through only so fast.Transferring RAW photos and a Full HD digital film can take a lot of time to transfer. Those are hugefiles to transfer so the USH-I enabled disc is perfect for that purpose. They are working on USH-IIwhich is supposed to allow up to 300MB/s transfers.

"I was out of space on my Droid RAZR 16GB and still had an empty microSD slot, so I figured I'd pick this up seeing as how it is a reputable brand in flash memory. I am glad I went with the Sandisk Ultra, because there is seemingly no difference in speed between this drive and the built-in internal memory of my phone. I record a lot of videos with my phone and I've been recording straight to this card in HD with no problems at all.Installation was a breeze. I took the memory card out of the package and inserted into my phone. Then my phone brought up a menu asking if I wanted to move my music, videos, and photos to the memory card. I selected all three categories, and in minutes it had moved all of my media onto the memory card. I didn't even have to do anything else. I had read some other reviews that said they had to reformat the card or mess around with moving files by hand, but I didn't have to do any of that.I haven't tried using the included SD adapter yet, but I imagine it will work as well as any other adapter. The adapter and memory card were both shipped in a little clear plastic case, which makes it easier to carry the adapter around with you. So you have it with you when you need it.The price on this card when I bought it was a few dollars more than the generic brands. I decided to spend a few extra dollars on it since I would be really upset if I lost all my photos and videos due to a corrupt memory card.

"This is one of the better reviewed SDHC Class 10 cards that utilized UHS. By reading the reviews you will see that it reads/writes at a better speed than many or most cards out there right now. Much depends on your phone, how your phone's OS stores information on a card and what's inside your device. For MOST of us; you probably will not notice anything different between this card and any other GOOD quality card out there. I usually pick the fastest cards on the market when the prices drop. The main problem, speed related is when you transfer large amounts of data (usually music) onto any card. If you use a standard USB 2 connection this card won't speed that process up. If you use a USB 3 or if you actually put this card into a USB 3 reader to do the transfer; then you'll see a nice boost. If your device requires a card that the product can UTILIZE and has the OS and chipset to take advantage of this FAST card; it's a no brainer.

After a long research about the SD cards. I came across this deal. I wanted an SD card for my new Samsung Note 3. None of the review was talking about Note 3. Most of the reviews were either about note 2 or S4.A few reviews were talking about possible problem of not able to recognize the card and getting into the cycle where you have to call SanDisk.

"I am primarily using this to supplement storage on my Microsoft Surface Pro and have a small library of movies and TV shows to carry around while I'm on the go.

The first was lost in the mail, but UPS found it after some days and brought it to me. I tried connecting my iMac (Snow leopard OS) via USB and got the message that it needs to be formatted so i can use it but i cant format because it requires Mac OSX 10.3 or later and my mac is snow leopard which is 10.4.\n\nBut I bought another one a week back and this time with a SD card reader that connects via USB directly. Now, for the first time in life i dont have to use a laptop only to transfer my photos, videos from my camera.\n\nThe adapter is quite small, but has good build quality made of plastic, has 2 slots ( micro sd and regular one). It comes with SD card adapter as well which attaches to USB so you can plug it directly in your computer/phone without having any separate reader on the go!\n\nThis works great!! I\'ve read some reviews where people say this doesn\'t work for iPhones or doesn\'t connect easily, but my friend gave it a shot and it worked first time right out of the box with her Galaxy Note 3 phone with no issues what so ever!\n\nI ordered both sizes at once - 64GB & 128GB cards. I\'m not sure which one I\'ll need yet as far as data storage purposes go but they were on sale last week and now that it\'s over I figure why not buy them before prices increase again.\n\nI use this with my Lenovo Phab2 Pro (Android device). The card works perfectly. No lag, fast file transfer, and increased storage space is much needed in a phablet like this one which has limited internal memory available due to needing large apps like Google Earth installed on them all the time for work.\n\nIt\'s a great product that I would definitely buy again and also recommend it highly to everyone. 5 stars plus another star if there was an option!\n\nIts good card, speed is ok. But in my case i couldn\'t use it directly as my mobile phone\'s memory slot was broken so had to connect via OTG cable and computer\'s USB port for transfers, but that isn\'t anything wrong with the card itself.\n\nGreat quality! I would definitely buy again. Also like how it comes in a nice hard plastic case which makes transporting easier if you\'re prone to cracking cards (like me).\n\nThis is my third ultra plus sd memory card by SanDisk...I\'ve never had an issue with previous ones but this time around I was pretty concerned because Amazon didn\'t give me the option for 128GB or 64GB, just regular sizes like 32GB; which won\'t cut it here in 2017.  But despite that size limitation (and not realizing it until delivery); once the card arrived safely home all my concerns flew away!\n\nI needed to store all my music and photos so when I took off on my journey, everything would be with me.\n\nThis was a great little memory card for using with my Microsoft Surface Pro tablet.  I\'m able to have my music with me at all times, plus a large number of photos. One item to note: this type of memory card may not be suitable for high speed applications (such as with a camera or for storing virtual hard drive type information). These micro cards are a 5 star if used for their intended purpose.\n\nThis SanDisk Ultra SD card adapter works great for my iMAC when using external storage devices that aren\'t compatible by default without this adapter! Now, I can transfer files from my phone to computer without having to use another laptop just so they could be transferred over again via USB which could take much longer and be frustrating in the process!\n\nIt\'s an SD card reader and I\'ve been looking for one with built-in lightning connectors too. So far it works as expected, but my only hope is that its longterm reliable because of all the reviews saying otherwise.\n\nSo many uses! This adapter allows you to connect cards via USB so if something happens in transit- no lost data. Has anyone tried using it while traveling? Curious how well this might work compared with other readers on board planes etc...\n\nI have one problem, though: My cell phone is a LG G3, and the case around my microSD tray doesn\'t allow for the card to enter fully into its slot without sticking out slightly.\n\nThis Micro SD card adapter has saved me so many times. I use it with my iPad Pro (which uses the standard size SD cards) but can be plugged into an Apple Lightning to USB camera connection kit if needed, as a portable storage device or even while traveling!\n\nThe one thing I don\'t understand though is why people are saying this isn\'t working on mac laptops - maybe they\'re using older systems? Mine works perfectly with my MacBook Pro running OS X EL Capitan 10.11.6 !\n\nAll in all, you really can\'t ask for more than what\'s here: it just works and does everything well.\n\nI bought this for my Huawei P20 phone as the internal storage was full and I needed some extra space without rooting it.\n\nThis USB adapter has made life so easy! I use it with my iPad Pro, making file transfers between devices or saving important documents a cinch. No need for messy cables anymore because this nifty little device does everything right!\n\nBut here\'s what you should know before buying:  The actual SD slot on your phone might not fit flush if its thickness exceeds expectations since there can be slight differences in material composition across various microSD cards available these days!\n\nMy iPhone is running out of storage, and I\'m getting really tired of having to delete older photos or apps just so I can take new pics/videos.\n\nI needed a USB adapter that would work with my SD card to make transferring files easier.\n\nAll in all, however there are some negatives - namely the case doesn\'t seem as robustly built compared to other competitors; but since you\'re mainly using its internal contents (the micro SD/microSDHC adapter) daily - where durability isn\'t quite such a concern - it still remains an affordable option for those always on the go!\n\nThe SanDisk SD card reader is a convenient way to transfer files directly into my computer or Apple device, eliminating the need for additional adapters on laptops/Macs. As an added bonus, it works with USB ports too! I\'ve been using this handy little tool recently after realizing how much storage media is everywhere nowadays - photos taken during trips abroad stored away neatly onto my Micro SD Cards which are perfect when traveling thanks to their portability (they\'re small enough for pockets!).\n\nI got one just like the previous commenter and it worked great at first. At least until I tried using a more expensive Sandisk Extreme Pro UHS II card (which says on its packaging ""not compatible with microSD cards"")... The adapter\'s USB-A plug was able to read/format this type of card successfully without issues but then after some use it started rejecting them - even other cheaper ones! So do not buy if you plan on using high speed video recording cameras or professional grade Micro SD Cards.\n\nThis USB card reader is a life saver for my iPhone 7 plus. I\'ve only used it with pictures and videos so far, but the transfer rate seems decently fast at least!\n\nI use this to transfer photos from my phone\'s storage onto my Macbook Air without any issues, though I do notice that transferring larger files takes some time compared to using a cable or other method.\n\nWhen using this adapter for reading SD cards it works well and transfers data quite quickly; however if you are trying to use an older iPad 4 or earlier model with iOS 7+, these won\'t work as they require lightning port devices instead of the old 30-pin connectors found on previous versions such as Gen1.\n\nI got this adapter after realizing that my SD card slot broke on one of my laptops, and needed a quick way to transfer files from a camera without waiting for another to get fixed via an external device or service.\n\nThis is ideal if you need to quickly upload content directly through the USB port instead of constantly plugging/unplugging your cable every time!\n\nOverall though, this adapter serves its purpose well. It\'s compact and convenient for onthego transfers but don\'t expect lightning speed which isn\'t really needed these days with smaller file sizes anyway!\n\nI\'ve been looking everywhere for a product like this to make my life so much easier! I\'m always on the go, so having an additional way of transfering data makes things super easy and quick.\n\nFor all you Apple users, if there was one item you NEED now it\'s this adapter - works with almost everything including iPhones (after 5), iPad Pros (and mini series starting from first generation) MacBooks laptops and more. Just hook up USB charging cable to your port then plug in USB powered devices like external storage drives flash drives etc., and data transfers will take place automatically when using these types of connections without needing any extra software or apps!
