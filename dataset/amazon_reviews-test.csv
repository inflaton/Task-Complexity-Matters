it works as expected. I should have sprung for the higher capacity.  I think its made a bit cheesier than the earlier versions; the paint looks not as clean as before,Negative,Negative
"This think has worked out great.Had a diff. bran 64gb card and if went south after 3 months.This one has held up pretty well since I had my S3, now on my Note3.*** update 3/21/14I've had this for a few months and have had ZERO issue's since it was transferred from my S3 to my Note3 and into a note2. This card is reliable and solid!Cheers!",Strongly Positive,Positive
It's hard to believe how affordable digital has become. 32 GB in a device one quarter the sie of postage stamp would have been science fiction less than a generation ago.I picked this up for portable music when I didn't want to schlep (or risk) a phone or iPod. Works great with all SD card readers.Select with confidence.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"I like this SD Card because it can take music video downloads, personal videos, files,docs, and multimedia images with a fast transfer rate of Class 10 speed. It can take games with large files very easily and still have enough space for apps. It's great for video cameras and camcorders with the supplied adapter. Fits very easily into smartphones and tablets SD Card slots. I recommend this 32GB SD Card to everyone.",Strongly Positive,Positive

The read and write speeds are better than the Samsung SD card that I had previously. I would not hesitate to buy another one of these great Micro SD cards from SanDisk. I also own their Clip plus MP3 player and it works very well. I think I'm becoming a fan of the SanDisk products.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"Works great in a Samsung Galaxy S3.  Formatted straight away, full size there.  I can't really tell the speed difference between this one and a slower card it replaced.  I guess the IO in the phone can't take advantage.",Positive,Positive
SanDisk never disappoints. As always SanDisk products are worth every penny. Nice product and quality and works great. I recommend this product to everyone.,Strongly Positive,Positive
This item is great!  I can't believe how small it is.  Imagine 64gb this size back in the 70's when they had whole buildings full of computers that couldn't pack this much space!  Great item.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"I've been trying for a while to get a hold of a 32GB Micro SD for my phone and tablet.  It's pretty fast compared to the 16GB cards I've been using.  I really saw the performance boost with my phone, which I have many apps, pictures, music, and other documents on.  The phone boots fully stable in about 2 mins as apposed to 5-6 mins.  My computer also can write to these cards much faster than the 16GB ones I was using.  If your phone, tablet or any other device can support it I recommend you purchase these.  Also you pay like half the price using Amazon as opposed to other retail stores who's price is at least double or more.  I've seen these same cards going for about $72 in my area.",Strongly Positive,Positive
I would recommend this card to everyone.Data Transfer speeds - excellent with this card on my Galaxy S2.  Didn't need to format the card or anything. I am 100% satisfied.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"I bougth this micro SD card after some trubles with other that i got from Kingston, i can tell that SanDisk is other quality, this is the best, my i9300 phone can read a 64GB very fast, the dta transfer speed from my pc to my is amazing, if you are looking for additional storage to you phone, for music, pictures and other type of files, this is for you.Pros-Very good quality materials of construction-Amazing speedUpdate after one year this memory is damaged I can not delete or put new files on it, I can not format this memory, I tried to format with my phone, with my pc, with a camera and nothing, now this is like a 64gb cd, the data in the memory is only available to read but I can not move, or delete it, I bought this memory to be used to backup all my data of my android device but now is only a readable memory I can not write data on it any more, I hope sandisk make a better products in the future!!! Total disagree I will buy a Samsung memory card expected a better quality.",Strongly Negative,Negative
"I am very happy with this Micro SD.  I could tell the difference in the response time in my BB curve as well as my Asus tablet.  If you want something that can transfer files Photos, Videos, and Music faster this is the Micro SD card for you. Now I will say this there are faster cards out there but not at this price.  This does the trick for my devices.  Now it you are a Professional Photographer you might want to go with the Ultra 3 Micro SD but if you are an everyday user this will work wonders for you device.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"Ordered this for a Galaxy S3.  Lasted a few months and then broke.  Is not accessible on several different PC's.Says ""limited lifetime"" warranty - BS.  You have ONE MONTH for Eco Zone.  Not only did I lose pictures but now I am out money because of a crappy return policy. In the future I will be buying Kingston, not Sandisk.",Strongly Negative,Negative
"more like 8mb/s in my Note 10.1 and that's using SanDisk's own app. A bit faster in my Note II, but still a disappointment for devices with quad core processors. Not sure if it's the card or the device, so benefit of the doubt.",Negative,Negative
"I used this for a few months in my phone, then it decided to quit mounting. I lost some pictures of pets who died shortly after. I got a replacement card, but I had to send in the old one, giving up any chance of recovering its contents. The new one's worked fine, but failing after 3 months in inexcusable.",Strongly Negative,Negative
"I purchased this card to use in my ContourROAM2 and it works great.  All I had to do was put the card in the camera, format it, and I was good to go.  It allows me to easily record hours of 720p/60fps video without running out of space or slowing down.",Strongly Positive,Positive
Upgraded from 32GB to 64GB card for my Galaxy Note phone.  Looks like it works fine and has full capacity.  Good product.,Positive,Positive
"Liked the first one I purchased so much, I bought a second one. Very, very fast read and write speeds at a good price, plus SanDisk has the best software and device compatibility.  Forget thumb drives - this is your most flexible, durable option.  Use direct in your tablet or smart phone and/or buy a decent usb card reader you can load this in and, voila, instant super-speedy, upgradeable thumb drive.  Works great in my tablet and in my newer card reader - and still kicks the butt of every thumb drive I know of even when used with my old plastic USB 2.0 card reader held together with scotch tape, lol.  Have purchased several microSD cards since they first came out, from 2GB to 32GB, and all still work fine - I cannot say the same re the thumb drives I purchased during that same time period.One point - beware of counterfeits.  Samsung is the number one brand so, unfortunately, they get counterfeited a LOT.  So check reviews and only buy from a reliable seller.  I suggest buying direct from Amazon (or Memory Mogul) - I have purchased from both with no issues.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"Used in my phone it's plenty fast and works just like it should. Unexpectedly comes with mini and full SD card size adapters, which is nice. Fool-proof packaging or whatever it was, that was laughable. Packaging was decent it just shouldn't have bragged about being impossible to mess up when I messed it up.",Positive,Positive
"I ordered this for my new Samsung Galaxy note II, and it works awesome! Installed it, and had no problems. I loaded all my music on it, and didn't even scratch the surface of the capacity of this card! I shouldn't ever have to worry about running outta room with this card. Highly recommended for any smartphone user!",Strongly Positive,Positive
"32gb of storage for my new Asus tablet, what's not to love? I can't imagine paying more for the model with the upgraded storage, especially since it's usually like $100 more. This thing was cheap and works great.",Strongly Positive,Positive
A lot of people want big memory which is fine. But you need to look at speed class. This one is class 10. Which is great when your taking pictures or video. It will not freeze because it can move the MB/s fast enough. Lesser speed cards will freeze or will say waiting for camera and you will miss the moment. Its also a Sandisk which is a name you can trust when it come to memory cards.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"There is something to be said about SanDisk. You plug it in and it just works. I've never had one be DOA or any memory issues throughout the years, both for my camera and storage products. I installed this in my Galaxy SIII and it recognized it right away and I was able to dump my music onto it. Speed seems great as well, no complaints.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"How do I praise extra memory? It fills my MP3 player with every song my heart desires, the sound quality is perfect. The ease of use is superb. It's great.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"works great on my sprint htc evo 4g lte.  Formatted w/ fat32 so of course the maximum file size is 4gb meaning no full length hidef movies.  However, this isn't a problem;  I bought the card for putting a music library on my phone.Like all class 10 micro-sdhc cards, it does NOT do 10MB/s, but it's closer than any other class 10 card I've ever tried.  Most do 3-4MB/s.  Kingston 32GB did 7MB/s.  This card does about 8-9MB/s.Can't wait till 128GB and 256GB cards become available and affordable.",Positive,Positive
"**Update 6.24.14**My 128 GB card stopped allowing writes via any of my card-readers on a Windows PC--either when it was inside any of several full-size SD card adapters (with the write-protect tab in either position) or plugged directly into the microSD slot of the reader.  MicroSD cards have no write-protect tab, so I was quite surprised and worried by this.  After failing to find any workable solution by searching online, I finally put it in my Chromebook and created a new folder on it there, then stuck it back in my Windows PC and it no longer gave me a write-protect error.  If anyone has a similar problem, I'd recommend doing something similar by putting it in any other PC, laptop, camera, etc you have available and try writing to it there.----------------------------------------------This portion of my review is necessarily being written as an update to my original review of the 64 GB version of this card, since Amazon disallows multiple reviews for what they consider the same item.  This portion concerns the 128 GB version of this card:I don't need a fast card, so the speeds on this card were not that important, besides which my test PC is not exactly high-end. Therefore I didn't count off for the speed results I got below, using a USB 2.0 card adapter, but I thought they might be relevant to some readers. While the card did reach the Class-10 and/or UHS-I requirements, it came in at under 2/3 of the claimed ""read speeds up to 30 MB/s for fast file transfer.""  Then again, running on a second PC using a different USB 2.0 card reader, none of the speeds even hit 5 MB/s, so this seems to be highly system-dependent.I only just got the card this week, and so far it works on *select* SDXC-compatible devices and exFAT-compatible operating systems:  some SDXC-compatible devices, such as the Panasonic HDC-TM40, do not allow cards larger than 64 GB (for whatever reason); this was stated in the manual, and I've confirmed this card is recognized as broken/corrupt/unusable in that device, whereas 64 GB exFAT cards work fine.  The 128 GB works fine (with original exFAT formatting) in my Toshiba Excite 7.7 Android tablet, and (predictably) not at all in my non-SDXC-compatible Galaxy Note 2 (though it possibly would if reformatted to FAT32, since a 64 GB card in FAT32 works fine there).I'll update my review to reflect any problems, issues, etc that I notice in the coming days & weeks.-----------------------------------------------------------------------CrystalDiskMark 3.0.3 (C) 2007-2013 hiyohiyoCrystal Dew World : [url removed as per Amazon rules]-----------------------------------------------------------------------* MB/s = 1,000,000 byte/s [SATA/300 = 300,000,000 byte/s]Sequential Read : 18.694 MB/sSequential Write : 11.921 MB/sRandom Read 512KB : 18.502 MB/sRandom Write 512KB : 0.680 MB/sRandom Read 4KB (QD=1) : 3.339 MB/s [ 815.1 IOPS]Random Write 4KB (QD=1) : 1.581 MB/s [ 386.1 IOPS]Random Read 4KB (QD=32) : 3.151 MB/s [ 769.4 IOPS]Random Write 4KB (QD=32) : 1.564 MB/s [ 381.8 IOPS]Test : 1000 MB [G: 0.0% (0.0/119.1 GB)] (x5)Date : 2014/04/24 16:53:49OS : Windows XP Professional SP3 [5.1 Build 2600] (x86)-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The following is my original review of the 64 GB version of this card, published April 24, 2013:This is a high-quality card.  I've used it in a variety of devices, through multiple readers on different pcs, in an HD camcorder using a micro to full-sized SD adapter, and I've never once had a problem with it.  It even works at full capacity in *some* microSDHC-only devices once its reformatted to FAT32 (such as my SanDisk Clip+ FLAC player and supposedly even PSPs via a proper adapter, though I haven't yet tested my PSP).  I keep anticipating someone coming out with a card with equal or better capacity and speeds at a comparable price, but I haven't seen one yet.  If these were cheaper, I'd have several by now.Make sure your device can handle micro or full-sized SDXC cards, or is one of those rare gems that state they support only as high as SDHC but have been tested to work with SDXC cards such as this one once they've been manually reformatted to FAT32.",Strongly Negative,Negative
"Lot of questions about this memory card fitting the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 tablet.  It fits and works no problem at all. The only thing is that after installing, instead of showing 64GB available, it only shows 59GB.Tried formatting the card but with same results.Have no idea if this is a limit set by the the Galaxy Tab 3 tablet, or is it just &#34;normal&#34; to buy 64GB and get less than that.As this is surely not a problem coming from the Sandisk memory card, my rating is a 5-STAR.  Excellent price, works great, and very quick delivery.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"When it comes to any kind of flash storage SanDisk has always been my go to brand because they sell quality items and stand by them if there's a problem. So as usual no complaints here, it works as descried and I haven't have any issues. Both read and write speeds are right where the specs say they should be.",Strongly Positive,Positive
The SanDisk 32GB Micro SD Class 10 is a reliable SD card with amazing transfer speeds. There is no noticeable lag transfering even the largest RAW images to it. Hadn't had any problem with it.,Strongly Positive,Positive
good card. work as describes. haven't had any issue with it or going pass metal detectors. no lost files or missing files.,Positive,Positive
"I'm amazed.  I ordered this from Amazon on Tuesday morning, and it arrived with Wednesday's mail.  VERY impressive service from Amazon!As has already been reported, the card formats out to > 59 Gb, and it performs perfectly in my Samsung Galaxy S III (which is also new).  Using two card readers on a fast PC, I transferred everything from my old 16GB card to the new 64 GB card in less time than it took to walk to the kitchen and get a cup of coffee.  So I think the Class 10 rating is correct on the card.Once I have some experience with the card in the phone, I'll benchmark the card and I'll also benchmark operations such as internally backing up my Android phone to the card.  Then I'll update this review with some accurate numerical data.  But in the mean time on first look, the person who said that the S 3 has problems with anything faster than class 6 may not have been correct - a full backup of the phone to the card was significantly faster than the backup with the old 16GB class 6 card.  Again no benchmarks yet but once I have them I'll include them here.Right now I'm very happy with this card and I'm really impressed - both with the card and with the unbelievably quick service from Amazon (and I'm in Atlanta where shipments like this one often take the full 3 days to arrive).",Strongly Positive,Positive
"I bought the 64GB MicroSD card at Best Buy because I needed one for my Microsoft Surface Pro. It provides all the space I need and for people who need a lot of space (videos, Quick Books, picture editing, games, etc.) this card is the one for you. If you don't need that much space, consider buying one for cheaper with a little less memory.NOTE: Be aware that this is a MicroSDXC format card. While most new computers support this format, many of the older computers do not (This includes all but a few tablets and smartphones). Before buying this, MAKE SURE your computer, tablet, or smartphone is compatible. If it is not, it will not work, period. For others who claim that the card doesn't work no matter what they try, chances are their machine cannot support MicroSDXC format.",Positive,Positive
"I got this because I just couldn't pass up the deal, $17.99. It has been incredibly fast in my HTC Sensation 4g. Pictures are taken and saved instantaneously. Only had it a few days, but have been very happy. Shipping was fast and the packaging was easy to open which is always great in my book. Only issue I had was I had to format it on my computer first before my phone was able to recognize it.",Positive,Positive
"You get a lot of storage at a small price. the micro sd with adapter, class 10 so it's fast . I am happy with this purchase and You will be too. I hope this review is helpful!",Strongly Positive,Positive
"The Ultra micro SDHC was fine once I got it working. Neither the packaging nor the Sansa Clip player inform the user that the player needs to be totally off before the microcard is inserted. If not, the unit will not read the card!  Otherwise? Love it and the storage for even 16 GB, let alone 32, is tremendous...",Strongly Positive,Positive
I upgraded to this after the price dropped. I originally had a 16gig sandisk card and it was in my mytouch 4g. I found toward my mytouch 4g's end of life that space is running low. So when I got my Galaxy S3 I bought this card. It works flawlessly. I highly recommend it. Now errors what so ever. Super fast transfer rate.,Strongly Positive,Positive
This item was priced right and fit right into my cell phone without any issues. Does what it is suppose to do and I don't know what else I could say. Being a class 10 it is suppose to be plenty fast for cell phone use which I am sure speeds up camera use to some degree. Has worked well and the shipping was fast.,Positive,Positive
"I got this memory card for my Samsung Galaxy S3. I was running out of room on my Sandisk 32gb Class 4 micro sd card. I also wanted a faster and more durable card. I was hopping to put lots of media on it. In addition to nandroid backups and custom roms. I later found out that since this card is formatted in ex-fat it would not work to make nandroid backups or flash custom roms. Most custom recovery and custom roms dont work with ex-fat. So my only choice was to format the card to fat 32, which meant I couldn't put any files larger than 4gb on it. Besides that this card is great and very reasonable price of $50. If your some one who doesn't root their phone or put custom roms, nandroid backups or put files larger than 4gb than this will not affect you. This memory card is fast and provides the most storage you can put on your mobile device at this time. The card is also water proof, shock proof and comes with lifetime warranty. Ive never had any issues with sandisk memory cards or usb flash drives. They last a really long time.",Positive,Positive
I've ordered other SD cards before but this one is the best overall. Shipping was excellent fast and reliable. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a quality product. Thanks again!,Strongly Positive,Positive
"It works but the actual R/W speeds are 18/8 MB/s, not even Class 10. It should be marketed as ""Sandisk Basic"", not Sandisk Ultra"", unless they mean ultra slow. Now is 2014 and there is no excuse for such slow card from Sandisk.*** UPDATE ***I have redone the test with NotePro 12.2"" instead of using non UHS-I PC and the latest results are 32/8.6MB/s. Since the read speed hits 30, I believe the device is DHS-I ready. Still underwhelmed by the write speed though.",Negative,Negative
Does it's job and fairly cheap for what it's worth. I had to return my first one and exchange it for another because the first one was defective. Sandisk really needs to do better quality assurance on their products. The second one works perfectly fine. I use it for my GoPro camera.,Neutral,Neutral
"The Sandisk Ultra 64GB Micro Card is a great addition to maximize the Samsung Galaxy IIIS, whatever version you got 16GB or 32GB. Is a very fast memory at a great price. Plenty space for pictures, videos and Android Applications. Good for the 1080 videos that the Galaxy IIIS use. Super Fast. If you got the most advanced smartphone in the market as I do, this is the memory to get at the right price.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"This product arrived in two days (Prime), it was exactly what I ordered and it works great in my Galaxy S3. I know a class 10 is not exactly needed in a cell phone but it cannot hurt, right? I'm very happy with this purchase.",Strongly Positive,Positive
I expanded my Samsung Tab 10.1 tablet from 1GB to 32GB works fast and don't see any lags. I can now store more than ten movies on my tab and play right of the flash disc with no problems.Very happy with this card.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"I bought 64GB version of the card to use with GoPro Hero 3 black edition.  It didn't work out.  The card worked OK if camera was set to resolution with lower bit rates.  E.g. worked fine in 720p with protune on, or 1080p with protune off.  However, in 1080p with protune on (bitrate is just shy of 6 MB/s in this mode -- much higher then with protune turned off) it was nothing but trouble.  Camera would sometime work, and sometime randomly stop recording for no obvious reason.  I first suspected camera, but testing with different SD cards, it ended up being SanDisk's card that was at fault.  My spare card, an old and cheap 16GB PNY (also class 10), worked just fine under same conditions and with same camera settings.Once it was obvious it was problem with the card, I found people on GoPro's forums that had trouble with this specific card as well (well, you always find these only after you figure it out for yourself, right?).  Anyhow, I did some speed tests with the card by doing simple write of 1GB file full of zeros using Unix dd utility to copy 1GB of zeros from /dev/zero (where else would you find that many zeros ;-) onto a file on the card.  The result was that on average, SanDisk's card would manage about 10.2 MB/s.  Just barely above the bar for class 10 card.  However, that was average over 1GB.  During the write test, the speed was oscillating with many spikes and drops.  Drops were as low as 7MB/s.  Uh.  I thought write speed of class 10 card should never dip below 10 MB/s?  For comparison, my old cheap class 10 PNY card was chugging along at constant 13 MB/s under the same test.  No spikes and no drops in speed.The card will probably work fine in most devices, as bitrates when recording 1080p video are often low enough and/or camera might have huge buffer.  But if you want to use it to record video at high bitrates, and your device doesn't have huge buffer to compensate for speed bumps of this card, you may run into trouble.  Be wary of using it in Hero3 in modes that have higher bit rates (e.g. 1080p with protune enabled).SanDisk's website lists part numbers as SDSDQUI-064G with adapter, and SDSDQUA-064G without adapter.  This conflicts with product description on Amazon.  While this is likely just Amazon not getting product description right again (a bit too common thing), it's interesting to note.[Update Apr 20 2013]:Some numbers from testing the card.  The test is extremely simple.  Write out 1GB of zeros onto the card using standard Unix dd command to read 128KB blocks of zeroes from special device /dev/zero and write it onto the card.  128KB * 8192 = 1GB.  dd displays transfer stats once it finishes.  While dd was running, I run iostat in second terminal displaying 1 second interval stats as a measure of current speed.  This was done on the Mac.  dd command line can be used as-is to repeat test on Linux system, however iostat command is different on Linux and would need to be modified slightly.  I choose 128KB block size, as that seems to be what device drivers merges sequential writes into anyhow.  Using different block sizes, results are comparable.$ dd if=/dev/zero of=test bs=131072 count=81928192+0 records in8192+0 records out1073741824 bytes transferred in 101.578307 secs (10570582 bytes/sec)So, 10 MB/s and all is good? Right? Wrong! iostat running in parallel with above dd command recorded this and so on until dd finishes writing 1GB of zeros to the card ... ]IMO, the last column should never dip under 10MB/s for card labeled class-10.For comparison, same test run against Samsung Pro 64GB micro-SD card:$ dd if=/dev/zero of=test bs=131072 count=81928192+0 records in8192+0 records out1073741824 bytes transferred in 52.869111 secs (20309436 bytes/sec) and so on until dd finishes writing 1GB of zeros to the card ... ]So, Samsung is on average 2x faster, but more importantly it's speed is much more constant.  And critically important, it never dips under 10MB/s.",Strongly Negative,Negative
"This is my third purchase. I own 4 of them and they've been working fine so far. I have them installed on my smart phone, cameras and even used as a portable storage device and I have not noticed any issues with them. Very good product.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"Needs little to no formatting and I have yet to see a SanDisk fail. Don't cut corners, almost every other brand of SD cards will fail on you except these (tried numerous brands with my devices).Just remember it takes a bit for devices to buffer the information off of the SD card and static can corrupt any SD card which is usually easily fixed with a formatting. Always back up your documents to a PC/Mac as soon as possible.Oh, and if you create playlists, slideshows, etc. on devices and remove the SD card, the device will not be smart enough to re-compile it after you put the SD card back in and you will end up with blank playlists even though you have the songs so WATCH OUT!Lastly if this SD card doesn't work for you for whatever reason google SD card formatting and it should help you out. These 64GB versions don't seem to have formatting issues like the 32GB ones do but even then formatting to FAT32 fixes it.",Strongly Positive,Positive
Comes with a nice little adapter for your MicroSDHC so you can use it as a normal size SD card also. pretty neat.Considering for the price at 24$ for 32gb is pretty reasonable class 10 is fast for any HD 1080p video recording or DSLR camera.I bought this for myself to use with the GoPro 3. Taking picture & Videos working great as it didn't give anycorrupted files videos & pictures yet. Its working pretty good. San-disk is a pretty reliable brand as you won't be able to go wrong with it.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"I have an old SanDisk SD card that still works. I thought their new cards would be just as reliable, but I was wrong. The microsd card failed yesterday inside my phone. I used the adapter to connect it to my computer, but it wouldn't mount. I bought this directly from Amazon and not a third party vendor, so I know it's genuine SanDisk.",Strongly Negative,Negative
"Great memory card.  Using this along with out Roku3.  Works great.  Fast transfer rate, good capacity, and reasonable price.  What else could you ask for?",Strongly Positive,Positive
Great storage size. Being the first adopter when it came out. Thought the sale price $119 is excellent. Got duped. It's been the same price since it was first introduced. Great for the action cam. Battery ran out before it ran out of memory.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"I use this for a Raspberry Pi, in the SD adapter, and it works so far.Also appeared to be the genuine part, although the prolific Sandisk counterfeiters have gotten really sneaky in recent years.I like getting MicroSDHC cards because they can be adapted to different device sizes.  For example, let's say I buy a used phone or e-reader that needs a memory card, and I'm not using my Pi -- I can just take the Pi's card, take it out of the adapter, and put it in the other device, rather than pay more money and wait a week for delivery of a new one.",Positive,Positive
This is a great buy. It work just fine and I use it everyday in my cell phone. The adapter is great when moving files from my computer to my cell phone. Will buy again if the opportunity presents itself.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"This Micro SD card is perfect for any smartphone user looking to expand the storage on their device. I personally am using one in my Samsung Galaxy Note 3. Works like a charm. It is adequately fast, cheap, and fairly reliable. If you are looking for extremely fast speeds however, you should consider the SanDisk Extreme series which are the fastest MicroSD cards in the world. My card came with an adapter that this card plugs into and it becomes a full sized SD card. If you are looking to use this in a camera or any other device that uses SD cards, please look elsewhere. These cards are not nearly as fast as the full sized SD cards used in cameras. The adapter should only be used for transporting data from the phone or other device, to a computer. All in all, these are a great buy for any smartphone user looking for a higher storage capacity. The price fluctuates often, so catch em while they are cheap! I got mine for around $30.",Positive,Positive
"I bought this on August of 2013.  As of April 2014 the card stopped functioning.  It can still be read, but the writing capability is gone.  That's less than one year.  I'm extremely disappointed in the longevity of this card.  My usage of it has been on my Galaxy S4.  I have about 40Gb of data in it.  Guess I'm going to have to look for another card that has a longer lifespan than this one.",Strongly Negative,Negative
Works as expected.  Based on price and performance this may be a best of breed product.  I have found the SanDisk brand to be dependable.,Strongly Positive,Positive
So this product is a large disappointment...bought it to use in my tablet but the card is forever getting corrupted....I've reformatted the card a few times but it's to the point now that even a reformat doesn't work..  Wasted money...don't recommend purchasing.,Strongly Negative,Negative
"My first card ordered was bad - my tablet and my computer wouldn't write to it, wouldn't read it. Amazon replaced it immediately and my new card is perfect. Reads and writes very fast, much faster than the HC in my phone. I'm glad I got the HC 1 for my tablet.",Positive,Positive
"I purchased 2 of these and am very happy with both. Good transfer rates. I found my last SD card caused the camera in my phone to delay when taking shots, but this one allows my phone to take pic's very quickly! :)",Strongly Positive,Positive
"My Samsung Galaxy Note 2 came with 8 gigs of internal memory. I discovered that apps can only be written to the internal 8 gigs of memory so I didn't want to fill up the internal memory with pictures, videos, music, etc.  I purchased the 64 GB San Disk Ultra MicroSDXC Class 10 card. I found a video on youtube to learn how to insert the card since I could find nothing on it in the phone's user guide.  It's real easy. Turn the Note phone off. Remove the Note's back plate. You see a plaque saying SD card in the upper left quadrant of the phone. Simply place the microsd card face up with the metallic pins facing down and towards the right into the depressed slot area to the left of the SD card plaque. Then slowly and gently slide the microsd card under the plaque until it clicks. If it isn't in correctly, it will tend to move back out from under the plaque. Do not force. Replace the back plate on the phone. Turn the phone on.  Go to settings, storage.  At the bottom of the page, you will see SD Card.  If the microsd card was inserted correctly, you will see the additional GBs of storage displayed there.  You will also see Reformat SD card and Remove SD card.  Use these settings to erase data from the microsd card, and to remove it from the phone.  Do not try to remove the microsd card from the phone without first activating the Remove SD Card setting.  You can damage the card and the phone.  The card came quickly and San Disk is a reliable brand. It's great to have the Class 10 rating too.",Positive,Positive
Arrived quickly and in perfect condition.  It works well with my camera using its standard size adapter and then is readable by my Note 8.  Seems quick enough for my Canon G12.  I would recommend this.,Positive,Positive
"Big card, a lot faster than the card that came with my phone. Allows me to switch to video and take pics faster. If you are going to get a cloud storage program think about just getting a couple big cards instead makes downloading and accessing chunks of data a lot easier.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"Bought this to add storage to a Sansa Fuze MP3 player.The card formatted correctly and works quite smoothly with the device.I also tried it using the adapter, in my Kodak digital camera and it was recognized instantly.  Pictures were saved quickly, allowing the camera to shoot again without undue delay.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"Having used SanDisk before in my photography, I of course went to them when it was time to outfit my new Samsung Galaxy S3 with an internal microSD card. I spent the extra bucks over comparably ""no name"" Micro SD cards and bought this variant. I took quite a few pictures and even transferred an album from my computer so I coud show it to friends on the go.After less than two months, the SanDisk microSD card started acting up. It was not recognized, stopped, restarted, removed itself, reinstalled itself onto the phone - erratic behavior. Here is where I should have taken it out immediately and tried to recover anything I could before things hit the fan...unfortunately I waited too long and this morning, for no other reason than I turned my phone on, the card shows up as blank. Neither my Windows PC, nor my Mac, can even detect the card and yes, i tried two different adapters, and I tried the SanDisk recovery which ""found no recoverable files"" even though I checked all file type extensions.I've apparently lost all the pictures I had on there. To top it all off, my GF's cheap ""no name"" card has never had an issue in her exact same phone and keeps chugging along merrily.Paying a premium for a substandard product that fails in use after two months? No thanks. I'm going back to Lexar, which hasn't failed me yet. I'm also getting rid of all my SanDisk cards for my DSLR's, just in case. The fact that SanDisk is the first card thats ever failed on me, and a new card to boot, does not inspire confidence. Buy and use at your own risk.",Strongly Negative,Negative
"I am very disappointed in this card.  I usually don't have an issue with SanDisk, but this 32GB ultra card died after two months.  Died as in, no longer recognizable by PC / Camera or any device.  Now I have to wrestle with warranty claim.",Strongly Negative,Negative
"I bought this card on the strength of the 64GB XDSC SanDisk in my phone right now.  It was a gift for a friend of mine and sadly it corrupted within minutes of first use.Initially it worked fine, then dead.  We checked in a laptop and Windows Disk Management screen told me it had a single 128K partition and the rest was unusable. The replacement sent by Amazon (Thank you Amazon, you are always excellent) is sitting in my office right now, I should probably check it out.",Strongly Negative,Negative
Initially when I inserted the card into the Samsung Galaxy S3 it recognized it but it wasn't able to format it correctly. After doing some research I found a free program EaseUS Partition Master [...] that will format the card into FAT 32 since Windows no longer allows you to do it by default. After formatting it into fat 32 the phone recognized the card and it works great now. I hope this helps anyone else that might run into this problem.,Positive,Positive
"Installed this in my Droid Bionic.I just backed up all my data using the included card reader adapter and the card reader slot on the laptop, and copied all data to a folder on my PC. Once done, reversed the process to my new micro sd card.Bionic recognized additional memory, some apps had to run updates, after adding card though this i don't attribute to the card itself it seems likely the apps were referencing something specific with hardware maybe.After the updates programs ran as expected.I did have one issue with PowerAMP media player where all the playlists disappeared. not sure why and havent yet researched this in the PowerAMP forums. I assume this same issue would occur with any card upgrade.",Positive,Positive

"Its like having my own personal cloud, So much storage in such a small item. This came at a great price and was in an easy to open package that made it easy to open and use right away. I ended up using it in my smartphone and when the screen cracked, I was able to back up everything to it and remove the card and put it in my laptop.",Strongly Positive,Positive
It works as Expected. No problems installing or anything. It fits my Samsung S4. It shipped really fast and was in packaging that I could open without the use of something sharp.,Positive,Positive
"I've had this card for some time now and I've only had one problem with it and I believe that problem to be with my phone. The card's formatting became corrupted and while I could still copy to and from using my computer, my phone didn't recognize the card. Copying the data off, formatting the card, and copying the data back onto it fixed the issue. It's really nice to have 64GB's of extra data storage on my phone.",Positive,Positive
"I wasn't absolutely certain if this would work in my Samsung Galaxy SIII (an SGH-I747M) from a regional carrier here in Alaska.I read several reviews, but took a chance the 64GB card would work in my device and was pleased when it arrived.Opting for the &#34;Frustration Free Package&#34; it was a very simple matter to open the little cardboard envelop to retrieve the contents.  A side note here, I do appreciate the Amazon packaging for items such as this, where a clamshell type of container adds no value...The card is well made and seems a quality product.  Installed the card and it was recognized instantly on boot.  The full capacitywas recognized.Maybe I am old school when it comes to memory cards, but I always format them in the device I intend on using them (at least initially.)  In this case, there were no issues.While I haven't scientifically measured read / write speeds of the card, performance is respectable.  I have suffered no issuesrelated to the operation of the card.I would highly recommend this product if you are looking for this capacity and your device will accept the MicroSDXC format.  To that end, several friends have purchased (and been satisfied) with this memory card in their devices.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"I will keep it short and sweet for potential buyers looking for facts and not b.s.I own two of the 32gb size of these cards for about 3 months now. They do work fairly well with cell phones and tablets, yet not so good with cameras, in fact these cards failed to work with my GoPro Hero3 camera and the customer service rep from Gopro claimed (and I happen to agree with him) that this card is not a true class 10 card let alone UHS-1.Benchmarks with my evo 4g with all allocation sizes the write speed never passed beyond 8mb/s while read speeds wondered around 25mb/s far below advertised speeds, well write speeds arent technically advertised (probably because they are of class 4 level)Benchmarks with crystal mark reported speeds even lower (due to adapter) with write speeds around 6mb/s while read speeds wondered around 20mb/s.Needless to say, if you are not worried about speeds and only about storage, these are perfect. If you want to use them for shooting high definition raw footage however, I suggest you not to loose your money on this, because even if your write speeds are around 10mb/s as the card begins to decay it will slow down to become useless.Again this review is based on GoPro camera and high definition raw recording.. For cell phones or for storage it works perfectly well with a bit of false advertisement..",Negative,Negative
"Replaced a smaller and slower micro SD card in my phone. I've had other brands corrupt and die in the past. I've grown to only trust SanDisk.It is faster than most other micro-SD cards, the price was right at $27.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"Simply put the card works well in my NOTE 3, gives me the extra space needed and to date has worked flawlessly. I upgraded from a 64GB Sandisk to the 128GB with no issues. Plenty of space available now in my phone and I can keep movies and music local. Some people have scoffed online about using such a large card but the reality of it is that you don't always have data service and when that time comes, such as when you're on a plane, its nice to have access to some movies and music that you've kept on local storage.So far its worked in my NOTE 3 and SG4.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"The package arrived on time, it's very well packed and it's got an adapter. It works perfectly with my phone, though it doesn't allow a computer format, once it's been on the phone, so it asks you to erase everything before you use it on a computer. So if you're planning on buying this for different purposes and devices, gotta be aware of this. I just need for my phone, so I transfer files with my usb cable, that works just right. I also give it a 3 star because it says there are 64gb, but even when it's totally formatted it only reaches to 60gb..sooo, I don't know where my other 4 gb are...anyways, overall it's working well. I do think it's expensive for what it is.",Neutral,Neutral
There really isn't much to say about a micro SD card: it either works or it doesn't. I bought this to install in my phone and it seems to be working fine. The fit was perfect and the performance is totally satisfactory. I've never had any trouble with SanDisk products and this will likely be no exception. It was a great value compared to places I had priced locally.,Strongly Positive,Positive
This chip is holding all my music and photos so they are ready to share with friends and family on my tablet. Quick response and no drop outs or lags.  Price was amazing!!,Strongly Positive,Positive
This is a very fast microSD card compared to the class 4 speeds. It looks nice and it works. I'm not sure what else I can say other than that I have no problems with it and it hasn't died on my yet.It's been about 4 months at least now in my Samsung Galaxy S3. The S3 had a reputation for breaking sandisk sd cards for some reason and it's only randomly unmounted about 3 times but easily remounted with a take out and put back in with maybe a restart on the phone to refresh some apps to see it. I think this is just because the Galaxy S3 tends to get really hot right below the sd card which might damage it a bit. I don't think they put it in a good spot but that has nothing to do with the card itself so just get it if you want a nice sd card.,Positive,Positive
"This is the best accessory that you can buy for your smartphone! Simple explanation:1) I loaded all my HD movies onto this micro SD card, inserted it into my Samsung Galaxy S3, and it plays them superbly without ANY delays, as it it up to 30mb/s read speed!2) The most important reason for this being the best accessory for your phone is to think about this: The premium you pay for an iPhone 64GB is $200. The price you pay for this 64GB micro SD card is $50 (depends on Amazon's pricing at the time). That means you get the same thing for $150 less, AND you can interchange your SD card between devices (if you buy a new tablet for example).No brainer.Note that it reads only at 10mb/s, so a 7GB HD movie will take about 10 - 15 minutes to load up.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"This is the latest version of the microSD cards Class 10. I purchased it for Asus MemoPad HD 7 tablet which I use mostly to play movies for my son. Since all of our movies are in HD I wanted to ensure I have a fast storage card so movies can play smoothly.This is also very important when taking pictures or videos. The faster the SD card is, the faster the device will process and store the picture and release the camera for the next picture.. with Android 4.2 JellyBean, Google introduced burst picture taking which allow you to long press the shutter and the camera will take several pictures in a row. This is great if you are trying to shoot something in motion. A fast SD card is essential for this feature to work properly.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"This is the SD card you need for your smart phone. I bought this for my S3 and been using it for over a year and it works perfect. I don't think ill ever have to worry about running out of space. Plus the price on Amazon, you cant beat it.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"This works on my phone and is amazing, however it seems to transfer pretty slowly.  I move a lot of music and movies on and off my phone so it can be annoying.  I'm not sure if my phone or this card is the weak link though.  I have Note 2.Anyways, it was cheap and it works, that is all that matters.  Buy it!!!",Positive,Positive
"When I first got this card, it worked perfectly in my Galaxy S3 phone.  Then, I rooted the phone and installed the Cyanogen Mod ROM to gain additional features not available from my carrier.  The card was instantly corrupted by that ROM, because it's formatted with a filing system the ROM doesn't support.  Fortunately there was nothing on the card I couldn't replace.I ended up having to use a third-party utility to format the card with a filing system supported by both Windows and the ROM.Once properly formatted, there have been no corruption or data loss issues and the card has performed well.If you are using a stock Galaxy S3 ROM, you'll have no problem at all.  You'll find the card roomy and fast.",Positive,Positive
"Works Great!  I was running out of room on my 32GB card on my Galaxy Note 3.  This solved my problems nicely!  Now I have enough space for movies, music and photos on my device!  I don't think I will be running out of space for a while!",Strongly Positive,Positive

"This microSD card worked fine for a year in my Samsumg Note II. I mostly used it to listed to downloaded music from Spotify. It has actually failed twice. When it failed the first time (the phone couldn't see that I had a card installed) I thought maybe something had merely corrupted it, so I formatted it, put it back in my phone, and re-downloaded all my playlists. It worked for two months and then failed again. I don't plan to try formatting it again, I'll switch to a different brand of card.",Strongly Negative,Negative
"I made sure to get the one in the retail packaging when ordering. It arrived next day from Amazon. I tore open the packaging and inserted the card directly into my Note 10.1. The card was picked up right away, no formatting needed. I will say, I had updated my unit to 4.1.2 first so I am unsure if the update is what made the recognition so easy. Already crammed it half full with movies and music. Plays all of them smooth with no lag or speed issues whatsoever. I think I will get another.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"Just got this 128GB micro SD card and put it in my Samsung Note 3, replacing a 64GB Sandisk card before. The Storage under settings show 119GB free space! It was as easy as 1-2-3.Testing it using SD card reader on my laptop, I get around 45MB/s read, and close to 30MBs write. That's above the advertised throughput.So far I populated around 100GB of video files, and after a week of 3-4 hours of playing videos from the SD card, there has been absolutely no glitches, no hanging, and no errors!",Strongly Positive,Positive

Can't afford to lose data, not that I can write to these anyway. Both went back.",Strongly Negative,Negative
"I purchased this memory card for use in a Galaxy S2 smart phone.  Music stored on the card plays without problems.  Works great and while not the cheapest, the price was not bad.********Update 11-28-12*********After about 1 month of use, the card failed.  After a few emails to SanDisk, they issued and RMA and promptly provided a warranty replacement.  On the whole great service.  These things are tiny and some failures are expected, so as long as this one keeps working, I still give it 5 stars.",Positive,Positive
"Bought this card to use with my Samsung Galaxy Tab2 7in tablet, based on others who have reported getting it to work in their Galaxy Tab 2.Bottom line, you gotta reformat this card as FAT32 with 32kb sectors to work in the Galaxy Tab 2, and that requires jumping thru some hoops as Win6/Vista does not even offer the choice to format as FAT32, only as NTFS or exFAT, neither of which will work with the Galaxy Tab 2 (Android v4.04)  You have to use 3rd party software to accomplish this.  A FREE solution is the EaseUS Partition Master free software you can download from cnet or direct from EaseUS.  I had a commercial package already installed (Acronis DiskDirector) that I used.Once fomatted as FAT32 with 32kb sectors, the card is recognized AND all the space is seen and useable.Highly recommended if you need the space.  I would assume that this would also make LARGER microSDXC cards work as wellJohn",Positive,Positive
"I got this for my cell phone and it was easy to put in. I have had not problems with it at all, it's been in my phone for a few months now and it's great having all the extra storage for pictures. I got it on time and it was so easy to remove from the package.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"If your card gets hot enough to be painful, it is defective and you need to contact SanDisk!From my experience, the larger micro SDs run hot on format and writing, but not to the pain threshold!I purchased one of these cards to use in a camera and Android tablet.  Great read speed but write speed was okay.  Used card for about two weeks and then all my files disappeared!  Tried to format the card and three different computers with XP, Windows, and Linux couldn't format it.  The camera and tablet couldn't format it.  I RMA'd it and got another because SanDisk is a good brand.  I did notice that when formatting or writing the card it got hot, very hot.Second card didn't last 24 hours and had the exact same symptoms as the first card.  Write a file or format it resulted in the card getting hot enough to reach the pain threshold.  I called up SanDisk and while explaining this was the second card I'd received with the exact same symptoms, when I mentioned it getting hot, they immediately issued me an RMA.  They said they were told to issue an RMA the moment they heard a card ran hot.Smaller SanDisk micro SD's or regular SD's I have or use don't do this.  I think SanDisk has an issue with this card.The last 4 digits of the part number refer to the date code and origin of the card.  Both cards had different date and origin codes.",Strongly Negative,Negative
"Does not work.  I have a card purchased at Best Buy that looks identical side by side.  BUT!  Transferring music onto the Best Buy purchased card was extremely fast.  100+ meg albums transferred in 2 to 3 seconds.  On these cards, a 61 meg album was at 18 minutes remaining with less than a quarter of the album transferred.  I bought two, so I figured maybe a bad card.  Tried the other, same thing.  Extremely slow.  Wonder if they are even real.",Strongly Negative,Negative
"My pour Note 2 has been working absolutely overtime.  I just love it so much.  So I am downloading a great many pictures, audible books, and of mp3's from Amazon.  With all of these many interest of mine working over time I soon found that the 32 GB microcard was just too small.  So when Amazon had a great sale on the 64 GB ones I purchased it.  My main concerns was would it work in my phone and be fast enough to do so seamlessly.  Well that it was this 64 GB microSDXC Class 10 did.  So whatever SanDisk wants to name it, the bottom line is that it works seamlessly and now I don't get those nasty warnings telling me my memory was almost full.  It is very nice that Samsung realized the need to be able to use such larger memory cards, and the Note 2 allows this size card use without any issues at all.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"I think this is probably a fine product, but it wasn't compatible with my Samsung Galaxy S3 phone. Formatted as exFAT (as it came from the factory), didn't work at all, but that's a known problem with the GS3.

"A few months ago I purchased a Samsung Galaxy 10.1 Note. It was my very first tablet. I didn't know much about them, a friend told me I need one. I couldn't do without it now. I was having issues with the storage, and was told I needed a SD card, and this was the one I was recommended because it had the most storage.I managed to put the in myself after watching a video on YouTube. My friend told me to downloaded App manager from Play Store, which I did and after clicking on App manager to open it, I successfully transferred all my Apps to the SD card. I checked in settings, now I'm happy because I have tons of room for other things.I've had it a couple of weeks now, even though I've added several more Apps and my bookmarks etc, I still have no storage problems.

"I originally bought a Samsung equivalent and then my phone was stolen, so I made the switch.  I have done some research and realized the class 10 and the SDXC are very important as it is the quickest rate of transfer.  However when you read Samsung's description and this one, Samsung claims 80 mbps and SanDisk has 30 mbps, after using both they are identical.  The class and the sdxc are the most important, they are almost absolutely identical.  Samsung's equivalent is $65 and this was under $50.  I haven't noticed a bit of difference, besides that maybe this mircosd card is a bit quicker and easier to move files around.  I store a lot on my phone, which is a Samsung Note 3, this works beautifully.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"It is so hard to imagine that you can have 32 GB is something smaller than a postage stamp, yet here it is.I bought this card to work with my Call of Duty Ghosts Tactical Camera and it works perfectly.  The camera came with a 4 G card which I filled in just over an hour at the local Kart track.  I missed the last bit of our race due to insufficient capacity.  The battery was still going strong so I needed more card for recording my adventures.This card fits the bill nicely.As a UHS Speed Class 1 (roughly equiv Class 10) card this SD card is quite capable of any photographic or video need up to Full HD (not 2k or 4k).  I use a similar card in my Canon 60D and am able to hold around 700 raw images, and a few hours of HD video.Here are some benchmarks for comparison including this card.MacBook Pro Retina SSD430 MB/s write323 MB/s readGeneric Class 6 4GB (Came with Ghost Camera)9.8 MB/s write21 MB/s readSanDisk Extreme Class 10 8GB21 MB/s write23 MB/s readThis Card San Disk Ultra UHC 112 MB/s write45 MB/s readWhat does this mean?  It means that you should have no trouble recording HD video reliably with this card.  Your camera will be able to save pictures quickly to this card so it is ready to take the next shot.  If you fill the card completely it will take roughly 12 minutes to copy all the data off of the card, assuming the device you are copying to can keep up.The tests were done in the built in SD card drive of the MacBook Pro using the included SD Card Adapter.Based on my tests, I would say that if you don't really need a Micro SD, then you should buy a standard SD card, your performance might be better and the price should be lower.  However, if you think you need or might need a Micro SD down the road, this is a suitable solution.",Strongly Positive,Positive

"Fast and Lots of storage, not a flimsy card either. Fells like its build tough. I would definitely recommend this to a friend. Side note, if your device supports it and you can afford it, get the 64GB. Youll appreciate NEVER changing out ur card.",Strongly Positive,Positive
the micro sd works great as described. but beware that the micro sd adapters are faulty. the micro sd will get stuck in the adapter. you will have to carefully rip apart the adapter to get the micro sd out thus damaging the apapter.,Negative,Negative
"Purchased in November 2012 (less than 18 months ago)  for use in my then new Samsung Galaxy S3.  It has never been removed from the phone until today when it failed.  Since the phone is still fine and the memory card is stored well inside, it's safe to assume this card has suffered no abuse.  Today, the card is totally unreadable.  It can't be formatted by the phone.  The PC doesn't see it at all.  It's dead, Jim.  I'll be contacting SANDISK about warranty today.UPDATE:  I've updated this from 1 start to 4 because although it failed, SANDISK is replacing it at no charge.  Sometimes stuff fails. If a manufacturer will stand by it, that speaks well.  Nice that because I bought it on Amazon I could search my orders and find the original invoice to use when I contacted them.",Positive,Positive
Works great with my Samsung Galaxy Tab3. Transfer speeds are excellent with this card.I would recommend this card to everyone.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"Arrived in manufacturers packaging so it looked authentic. I was still sceptical based on reviews I read from others on Amazon, so I called thecustomer service phone number for San disk and they verified it was genuine. You will need a magnifying glass ro see the numbers printed on the back of the card, or alternately you can take a photo of it with your smartphone, I used the Galaxy S3 om Macro or text setting and then enlarged the photo to read the numbers.very happy with this card fast response, have hundreds of photos and songs on this card and it works great.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"its a memory card and has the reputation you expect from SanDisk. I thankfully didn't get a knock off, counterfeit, card because It was bought official threw Amazon. it works as advertized and at full capacity (59~ gigs after formatting, which is to be expected) it has good speed for things like games movies music and photos (view/shooting) I've owned it for about two weeks now and its been reliable giving me no reason to doubt it.if you have a low capacity phone/tablet/device you should buy a card and SanDisk is probably the brand you should go with. the price is rite (through Amazon) and they are backed by both the manufacturer and the distributor with a warranty (Amazon A-Z 30 day, and SanDisk- 6mo parts I think it is) its better than you can get with budget or discount cards you find elsewhere.I recommend this product to customers looking for quality storage space.",Strongly Positive,Positive
Great quality product. Purchased for GoPro Hero 3 and works great with the adapter. Would recommend to anyone buying a camera with micro SD.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"Purchased 2 of these for my Samsung Galaxy S4 (AT&T). The cards work without any issue; storing games, movies and music on them. I would recommend to anyone and would most definitely purchase these again without hesitation. As always, a big thanks to Amazon for 2 day shipping!",Strongly Positive,Positive
"For the price it was a great buy. I would recommend to all. It has a pretty high transfer rate, and comes with an adapter so you don't have to worry about that.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"Ordered this from Amazon and was expecting it to work perfectly like my other 32GB sandisk (in my galaxy s4). However, I was really disappointed that upon placing it in my note 10.1 2014 edition the card become unrecognizable. I tried reformatting on the computer, on the phone, and yet, no prevail.

I have this sd card for awhile now and I would have to say its awesome. The service was great. The product got to me at a reasonable time. My overall experience is 10/10. Thanks.,Strongly Positive,Positive
Nothing much to say other than it works just fine and it has great price. Needed another one for my phone after my first one got corrupted after a systems update. Just a tip: If you phone prompts you for an update you might want to take the card out before doing so; I corrupted two cards that way.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"I bought a class 10 Samsung and returned it after I found out the speed was actually lower than that class. After buying and using many different brands, I have found that this company makes the fastest, highest quality, memory cards. Other companies advertise their cards as being certain classes but they are not up to par. I think $19.99 is a steal; best buy sells this product for $39.99. (As of 7-11-12)The card I recieved must have been a dud. It is broken and my phones are not able to read it. When I try to use it in the computer it says the card is damaged. I will be returning to Amazon.",Strongly Negative,Negative
Works great with my Galaxy S4. Didn't need to format the card or anything. Just popped the card in and everything worked great out of the box. Transfer speeds are excellent with this card. I would recommend this card to everyone.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"Easy to install and performs per specs.  I have expanded the capacity of my handheld scanner with this product.  The convenience of these micro products is phenomenal!

We do more with less--that's innovation, that's capitalism at its best!",Strongly Positive,Positive
"Since there are almost three thousands reviews already, I bet almost everything about reading and writing speeds have been covered. I'll just try to provide some specifics from my experience in case if somebody is searching with these keywords. I've copied some WAV and MP3 files to this card from a fast PC (3.4 GHz, 16GB RAM, 7,200 RPM HDD, 64-bit Win 7, etc.) with a built-in card reader. The card reader maybe my bottleneck. Anyway, the observed average writing speed was around 9.5MB/s.Tried this card in Nokia 3555b. Logically this phone cannot read more than 8GB MicroSDHC cards, but it it. However, it saw the card as being only a 2GB card. Tried inMotorola Flipout Unlocked GSM Quad-Band Android Phone with Bluetooth, Camera, QWERTY Keyboard and Wi-Fi - Unlocked Phone - US Warranty - Black. Played those WAV and MP3 files and it worked very well. Tried inMotorola MB520 Bravo Unlocked Phone with Android OS, 3MP Camera, FM Radio and GPS - US Warranty - Blackwith the same files, and it worked well too. No hiccups. Then inserted (and left it in) inBLU Studio 5.3 II Unlocked Dual Sim Phone with Dual-Core 1GHz Processor, Android 4.1, 5.3-inch IPS Capacitive Touch, and 8MP Camera - U.S. Warranty (Black). So far so good. Will update this review if problems will arise.It was sold and fulfilled by Amazon in a frustration-free packaging. I love this packaging not only because it does not have nasty blister pack that cuts your fingers, but also because it is eco-friendly.",Positive,Positive
"The first few weeks after I bought this, I had some problems (like my phone can't detect the micro SD card). I tried formatting or repairing the card, but no success. So I returned this to SanDisk and they willingly replaced this in a week. No more questions asked. And since then, I'm still using the 2nd card that I received. No problems until now.",Positive,Positive
I just recently received a new Nook HD+ Tablet as a gift  and wanted to increase the storage capacity as well as convert it to an android base system with the N2A software! This card was compatible and has really increased the flexibility of my new Nook without having to root the system and void my warranty. I can use my new Nook either way. Plus the card was at a reasonable price and really the latest in technology!,Strongly Positive,Positive
"it is extremely small. so small in fact, that it could easily get lost. so i recommend that once it's in, you leave it in. but it's a great idea, to allow the camera's, phone's or any other device to be that much smaller. i've only had it for a short while, but so far so good.",Positive,Positive
"My original two cards were manufactured in 2012 and over time started affecting the functionality of our phones.  Some internet research resulted in reading another review on Amazon with similar problems and discussed to contact SanDisk support for replacements due to a known silicon bug.  The new cards arrived in about a week and we returned the old cards with the defects.  Only hassle was was trying to read the serial and date codes off of the car, but a phone with 4X zoom made it possible.  SanDisk customer support was easy to work with and the products (new and old) are fast and worked great.",Positive,Positive
"I use this for my R4 SDHC Dual Core for my 3DS XL. It holds about 30 movies currently, and it also holds a number of different emulators plus games, plus It holds about 150 NDS games on it as well, and I STILL HAVE 5gb of storage left for extra stuff. Simply incredible how they are able to offer that much storage in such a little package. Thank you sandisk for being the foremost leader in Memory technology. My hat goes off to you. And they do it all at an affordable price.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"Got extremely solid speeds with it, no slack on my Android.  Solid Micro SD card with gigantic space.It works.  Awesomely.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"I'm not a heavy user of data but enough that my pictures and music videos wouldn't fit on the factory 4 gig card. You can never have enough memory as it gets used up quick. It has the advertised memory capacity rating and has improved speed on my smartphone and tablet when moving pictures and videos to different folders. No lag compared to the cheap factory memory card. Buy the better card the first time, you won't be regretting it later. Would recommend and buy again",Strongly Positive,Positive
"I really want to like these and I do trust SanDisk more than other manufacturers of memory cards. That said, I'm moving on to my 3rd card. Thank you Amazon for having exceptional customer service, or else I'd be very upset.Basically this card will suddenly not allow writing to it anymore. You can't save files to it, you can't delete files from it and you can't event format it. I've tried doing all three in different OS'es and devices with no luck. Doing some reading on the SanDisk forums this seems to be happening a lot with these cards.I'm returning this to Amazon and trying my luck with a different brand to see what happens.",Strongly Negative,Negative
"Purchased this as a memory addition for the Surface. Great way to add all files for a meeting, so the laptop can stay behind. This card is fast enough so you can access files quick. Great Product.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"Nice memory card.  I think 16 gb is the sweetspot for price and size, can't imagine filling it.  I only buy class-10 cards just in case a little speed boost is important.  I have this in an Android 4.2 player, works great.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"This works very well.  It is a class 10 memory card which ALL video cameras like.  Memory that is less than a class 6 plays back on some camcorders with a jerky playback.  Not with this memory chip.  Worth the money and at 64GB of storage lots of video time, photos and music storage.  The added value of the adapter is a plus.  This is a FIVE STAR product.

Phone missing extra storage space? This was a great purchase and at a great price with Amazon. Would recommend for the movie watcher or photo/music enthusiast.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"Reliable and inexpensive. However, it's quite slow, far, far slower than the 64GB samsung pro microsdxc. The Samsung works well for interactive use while I would only use this Sandisk card for applications where speed isn't important.",Neutral,Neutral
"Good quality. I've been using it several devices (phone, tablet, and computer) with no troubles at all. Glad I chose this one.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"I had this for my smart phone and it kept dismounting itself.  I did some research and found out that there are others experiencing the same problem.  So, I returned this and got Transcend instead.  Transcend works fine with no problem.",Negative,Negative
Great product! came with an adapter to plug into a camera or a regular sized card reader. The ultra allows for faster uploads and downloads onto the card!  Great for pictures and apps!,Strongly Positive,Positive
"I bought this primarily to use in my Surface Pro. It would randomly dismount itself. I do not know if it was the Surface's fault or the card's fault. Upon doing a little internet searching, I found this to be a common problem with Sandisk cards and the Surface Pro. I used another brand microSDXC and it has worked fine.",Negative,Negative
"This card was used in a phone without a large amount of write stress (which does shorten the life of the card - it was not written to over and over in the phone).The card is now totally unwriteable - on a Mac, a Linux machine, or the phone - writes all ""seem"" to succeed but even low-level reformats don't actually *do* anything - the exact same files are there after every change, untouchable and frozen forever.10 months of use out of a memory card and then a really weird failure like this (neither the Mac, Linux machine, or phone reports any error) is not acceptable quality from SanDisk.",Strongly Negative,Negative
Been using it for a month and everything works fine.I have my SD card encrypted and it does take a little bit longer to transfer.It does get warm when I transfer files for more than 2 minutes but I have not had any performance issues with it.,Positive,Positive

Very good product. I got tired of taking pictures and the memory is not over. So good that I bought another,Strongly Positive,Positive
"64GB for this price is a nice deal, especially when you are trying to add storage capability for a tablet or phone.  Keep in mind that not all phones/tablets/devices support 64GB, so you may have to get the 32 GB instead.  Performance is very good, especially when weighing with price and capacity.",Positive,Positive
"I own several video recording devices (Surveillance, car-based DVR systems, etc.), and the SanDisk Class 10 cards (always use class 10 cards when dealing with HD video) are the only ones which survive these extreme environments.I have been using SanDisk for years, and while I do admit to trying other great brands once in a while, I always come back to SanDisk, and will stick with it.Many non SanDisk brand cards might advertise Class 10 as well, but don't achieve the same writing speeds.  In fact, cheaping out on these cards may result in your video recording devices to become unstable, or worse, corrupt data.Highly recommended!",Strongly Positive,Positive
"I have had this for 8 months, and the SD Card already stopped deleting files and keeping pictures.  I have tried reformatting, and nothing helps.  Not cool.Update - April 2, 2014 - I contacted Sandisk and I am sending the problematic card back for warranty replacement.  I hope this will resolve the issue with the card.  I will keep you updated once the process is complete.",Strongly Negative,Negative
I got this to go in my smart phone and it does the job great!  Inexpensive and it includes an adaptor card so I can use it in applications without a micro-SD slot.  This expands its versatility.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"Whether I'm on vacation or just taking photos and videos around the house I don't trust any other memory cards to keep all my memories.  I bought this card mainly for my Contour ROAM 2 Helmet Cam, but I've been using SanDisk Compact Flash Cards in my Canon DSLR and SanDisk SD Cards in my Panasonic HMC40 video camera and I've never had a single problem.  They don't fail, I've never had a file corrupted, they've survived x rays at the airport and extreme weather conditions.  Sometimes I'm tempted with the prices of other memory cards but in the end I go with the SanDisk for that warm and fuzzy feeling of knowing all my photos and videos will be perfectly safe.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"Works great! Perfect price,I'm using mine for my digital camera, and my DJI Phantom FC40.The chip holds tons of data and is exactly what I needed!Highly recommend for anyone needing both micro and standard SD. It's great to have the ability to plug and play to get the data!Buy it, Buy it! BUY IT!For the money I should have got the 64GB card.I will be buying more.",Strongly Positive,Positive
I got a few of these for tablets and phones and they have been fine. I loaded them with movies for a trip and they playback was perfect. I used one in a camera for video and it was plenty fast enough for the clips I was taking.,Strongly Positive,Positive
Upgraded from the 32GB and very satisfied. Works great with my phone and large library of music. Def would recommend.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"Recently upgraded to Samsung Note II. I've been wanting to carry more of my music. Turns out I only had a total of 12GB of music. But with the new 64GB card, that still gives me another 52GB for my photos, spreadsheets, word docs and PDF docs. I've been listening to my music stored on this card--No delays.",Strongly Positive,Positive
Stopped working and could not reformat.  Didn't have good luck with this item or the vendor selling this item.  Hopefully just a bad one...sandisk is usually pretty good,Strongly Negative,Negative
"Couldn't wait to test it when I got home. Yes, the capacity is 128GB but shows less due to binary code. I managed to stuff 53 Hi-Def movies on to this. That is just insane. Speed is pretty good too. I managed 17MB/sec write and 45MB/sec read using a USB3.0 reader. This is for files 64KB or bigger. It slows down substantially with smaller files - typical for SD cards and thumb drives.Great warranty and only a small premium over 2 x 64GB cards.No regrets - highly recommended if you can get it at a decent price.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"Excellent quality memory; good deal for the price! It functioned perfectly, good speed, and meets all my needs. I would definitely recommend for anyone using tablets. I am planning to buy another one shortly.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"This Works As Expected And is WAYYYY faster than my 8Gig Class 2 card.my old card would slow down my phone as it was close to being full and would take forever to load up everything Music Files, Pictures Etc. This Card however I've Loaded more than 8GB of stuff on there, Put everything from my old Card and more, It Reads and loads Up Fine, No need to wait. BuY THIS CARD",Strongly Positive,Positive
"I run this in my Samsung Galaxy II. Works like a champ and it's really fast. Unless your phone supports exFAT this is as big as you can go. It might find it, but you will only be able to use 32GB...that's why the file system is called FAT32.",Strongly Positive,Positive
The internal memory on my ASUS tablet is kinda slow.  I installed this bad boy into my tablet and install the OS onto it.  Now the tablet runs nice and fast!,Strongly Positive,Positive
My old microsd causes images taken to get corrupted probably because of the write speed it can't handle. This one works great! It has been a a few months and it still working good. I haven't seen any problem at. It seems pretty fast compare to my old  transcend. I would recommend it as Sandisk is already proven. It might cost a little more but it seems more reliable.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"My S3 did not recognize card when it was formatted exFAT.  S3 seems to have problem supporting exFAT format in higher capacity like 32gb or 64gb.When I inserted the SD card, it just kept saying that SD card was ""damaged"" and I just got stuck on ""Unmounting SD card"" screen when I tried to format it on my phone.I just manually formatted the SD card to FAT32 in Windows 8 and inserted it into my phone.It runs smooth now.  Seems like a lot of people are having trouble to get the SanDisk 64gb to work in S3.  Hope this helps.",Negative,Negative
"Ive had the card for over a month, using it in my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1.I filled the card with a few TV shows and movies to watch on the go, as well as many PDFs and MS Word Docs.The MS Word and PDF files often get corrupted after use. THe larger files seem to stay intact. I moved the smaller files into the internal storage and havent had problem since.Im hoping Sandisk has a decent return policy.",Strongly Negative,Negative
"I bought this to use with my GoPro Hero3 Black, and it works great! No problems at all. For the price, it's hard to beat.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"I didn't see this brand listed on the GoPro website as one of the recommended cards but I've never had an issue with SanDisk before so I gave it a try. It is a UHS1 card so it doesn't ever stop recording due to write errors. For the price, you can't beat the quality that comes with it. It also included a microSD to Standard SD card adapter so that you don't need a different card reader if you have one for your old SD cards.",Strongly Positive,Positive
I love the additional storage for my pics/videos on my S3.  So far no problems.  Reads/writes with no problems or delays.  I got a great price on this as a gold box deal.  Too bad I could only purchase 1.  I can also use in most of my other devices with an adapter.,Strongly Positive,Positive
Fast and reliable. So far no problems in my Samsung Galaxy S4 phone. Plus I got it on sale and well worth price.,Strongly Positive,Positive
I upgraded from my 8 GB SD to this one and it was great to have the extra space.No problems with it.I removed the SD card from my phone and copied the files up to my computer using the adapter that came with the new card.  I copied the files to my new 32 GB MicroSDHC and installed it in my Galaxy S4 and it worked great.I liked the color. Makes it easier to see on my black desk.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"I bought 2 of this, one for a Hero3 camera and one for a Galaxy S3 mini, They both work excelent, recommended for video shooting. Very good price!With the adapter you can use it on a SD card reader (SDHC compatible)",Strongly Positive,Positive
I've used a number of these.  Just bought some more.  They're well rated.  they've always worked well for me.  Good price.,Strongly Positive,Positive
Worked well after reformatting. Good thing I was able to download the free app on line after reformatting. Memory to spare. I like being able to download and snap photos without thinking how much space left in the phone.,Positive,Positive
I was better off with my 32gig card.  This thing was nothing but problems.  The phone does not see it half the time and it is SLOW.  The phone keeps asking to Re- format it.  I got it to see the card after a reboot.  It is still SLOW.I will be buying the Samsung 64gig card for my Samsung Galaxy Note 1.  I have seen good things from Samsung.,Strongly Negative,Negative
"I bought this for my GoPro and it does great. The only problem I experience with it is, if you download your pictures and videos from the day, you should re-format the card before trying to use it again. It seems to get confused where you left off when you re-install it. I lost out on getting some pictures and video because of not doing this on the second day of my SCUBA vacation. When I would start the GoPro in video mode, it would record about 6-15 seconds then stop automatically. Haven't have anymore problems since re-formatting after each night's downloading. The videos, set on 1080 looks great.",Positive,Positive
Worked for awhile and then android would blow chunks (unexpectedly removed).  Windows sometimes could not read them and just blew up explorer.  Formated FAT32 .... ect ect ect over and over.  I'm done with SanDisk.  I think the problem is the CLASS 10 part of these cards.  All other cards I have work fine and they are less than class 10.  Maybe this was a bad batch because my replacement card a few days later (from Amazon) did the same thing again.EDIT: Decided to pick up the card that was laying on my counter for the last 3 months and give things another try.  Still does not work in HTC Evo LTE or EVO 3D.  Finally got it working in Galaxy S3.  Still very frustrating.,Strongly Negative,Negative
"Super fast reading and writing. This thing performs under extreme condition; writing multiple large files, videos and photos, all at the same time. Have owned it for about 2 weeks now, and extremely happy with it.Formatting is super easy and fast",Strongly Positive,Positive
"Insert it and use it, it is exactly that easy to use. And did I mention it is also very fast? I purchased this for my new Nook HD+ tablet and it gives me a lot of storage space for anything I wish to keep on the tablet, pictures, music, documents, eBooks, anything else I wish to create or copy to the tablet. I am very pleased with the performance and price of this purchase.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"Plugged in and worked out of the box in my Samsung Note 2 (Verizon).  Using an app to test the speed while it's in my Note, was hitting 8 - 15 mb/s for writing (avg high 8s), consistently in the 10mb/s for reading, so this seems like a legit class 10, and I don't think the write test really worked the greatest for whatever reason.  I'm with WinXP still, but to anyone else wondering, the exfat format the card comes in is what you want, don't format to fat32 if you computer can't read it, your phone/tablet/etc. most likely will read it fine.",Positive,Positive
"A micro card that has 64G still just blows my mind. I put this card in my Galaxy Tab and I love it. It gives me plenty of storage for my music, videos, movies, photos, etc. The speed is awesome too. That makes uploading to it that much more enjoyable. I recommend it.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"Shop around, and you will be surprised how good of a deal this is.Combine it with something else to get free shipping, and it's a low cost winner.Technically speaking it works great, especially for a Go Pro Camera which will benefit greatly from the enhanced storagecapacity.Put it in a digital camera, and you won't need to worry about running out of space.Just bought my second one, that's how much I like/recommend it",Strongly Positive,Positive
"Bought 2 of these for the wife's & my Android phone. When her's failed after 2 months, we figured it was just luck of the draw. Now mine failed after just over 4 months, losing a bunch of photos & videos (I made sure to back up every few weeks but even so, we just lost a bunch of photos of our 2 month newborn).Clearly SanDisk had a bad batch with this lot and as the return policy is horrible, I won't be buying any more SanDisk, no matter how cheap (when we bought them on sale around January 2013 they were over half the price of similar SD cards; again, SanDisk clearly knew they had a bad batch, shame on them for dumping them on the customer, no matter how cheap).While I would presumed they would have solved the problem in production, buy at your own risk, SanDisk will sell product with ridiculous failure rate.EDIT: After submitting my review I did some more research on other sites and the low star reviews here. SanDisk is so clearly guilty of selling a defective product from the batch about 6 months ago. Which as I said before, is when they put them on a super discount sale. They knew what they were doing and they are thumbing their nose at customers who just fell outside warrantee (like myself).To knowingly sell your customer something that is going to fail at an unacceptable rate and then ignore them because it failed a little bit outside warrantee is just bad faith. I beg people considering buying this product to not do so, and thumb up the reviews warning of failures. It is only when companies lose sales do they reconsider not screwing their customers like this.Personally I have bought several SanDisk thumb drives, CompactFlash cards, and a Sandisk MP3 player. The thumb drives were ok but I wouldn't buy another mp3 player from them (it was buggy as hell). Up until now I had an overall neutral to favorable opinion of them, not anymore.If you think I am overreacting, please just skim through a few pages submitted in springtime of 2013. There is at least one or more ""6 months and it failed"" reviews per page.",Strongly Negative,Negative
"I'm using this in a NOOK HD+ (Customized Android OS). I use it mostly for music, a few docs. It works as expected with no problems. I have several SanDisk MicroSD cards, but this is the only XC card. They have all performed as expected. I have been pleased with both his memory card, as well as the other SanDisk cards.",Strongly Positive,Positive

"To begin, I am not that knowledgeable in tech matters so when I received a new Galaxy Note 2 as a gift and decided to add storage I read some reviews on the SD cards and was reading about the compatibility of the 64 GB cards (exFAT or Fat? I guess the exFAT was a successful diet), I was concerned somewhat but I ordered this one anyway and this is what my experience was. I added some music and videos onto the card using my Apple Macbook Air with no problems and then inserted it into the Note 2 with no problems and it immediately loaded everything with no problems. I have since taken it out and added some more music to it and it is working perfectly. I did not reformat or anything like that which was a great relief. Although I have only used this item for a week now with issue which means something could go wrong in the future, I would give it more than 5 stars if possible because it was easy for someone like me. I know I used the phrase no problems multiple times but when you are my age and things go smoothly with no problems it is very good.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"It's a micro sd hc, stores files, and is great at it.I don't really know enough about these kinda things to go into details of how fast it is at transfering files.But it worked great for copying video files from my computer, placing the same thing into my LED tv (has a USB port) and watching the files from there. 8gb video files would play perfectly fine. Perhaps that's saying enough about it? Worth the money!",Strongly Positive,Positive
"The product is OK, but my card does not acheive the rated write speed of 10 MB/sec.  Most applications probably don't need to hit 10 MB/sec, but my GoPro Hero 3 does need the full bandwidth and thus would bomb on me sometimes.  As tested, my card got between 8-10 MB/sec using the larger block sizes.  I complained to Sandisk about it and they allowed me to send it in for a replacement which I did (and took almost 2 weeks), but the replacement behaved the same way.  I would say this card is OK for most applications, but if you need top end speed, I would go with another card.  I bought my card in May 2013 and had it replaced in August 2013 so hopefully they have fixed this problem by now.",Negative,Negative
Pay attention to your application and what class your card is!  Class 4 or unclassed may be cheaper but it may not give you the performance you want. Don't be pennywise and poundfoolish... this was purchased to go into one of the newer MK808 version tv streamer dongles and those take class 10. For the price this was a good value.I have been using SanDisk xD and sD regular and micro for 8 years now and always found them to be a consistent and high grade storage card. I can recommend this brand.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"Losing pictures, video, and tunes after 9 months on a Samsung Galaxy Note 2 (stock android).  Looks like this is a common problem.  I will try my luck with Sandisk on Monday.  If I don't get a replacement, I will never buy a Sandisk product again.  I paid the premium for ""Sandisk Quality.""  I am very disappointed.UPDATE:Sandisk will be providing a replacement SD CARD.  However, my data loss and downtime cannot be replaced.  SanDisk lost their ""premium rating"" in my eyes. It's going to take a while for them to get it back.",Strongly Negative,Negative
This is great. I use this with my Contour Roam camera. Works great. lots of room for video. Transfer speeds are as expected.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"Great capacity. I purchased this when I first purchased my phone (Samsung Galaxy S3) and have had no issues with it. Great write speed. Excellent way to store all your music, videos and photos. Great to take videos with as well. More than enough capacity for anything I'd need it for on my phone. Can't go wrong with the SanDisk name either. An industry leader and well known for quality. Of course you always want to backup any and all of your data for continuity purposes, but I've never had any issues with this card.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"I haven't done any formal benchmarks, but the device seems pretty slow. I haven't seen any real performance boost vs. my old card even on bulk file copies. I have another 8GB samsung card that may be a knockoff that performs noticeably better than this card.I'm using it anyway. I don't really have the time to return it or anything.",Negative,Negative
"Works great, good transfer speed, capacity is as claimed.Only con I can think of is that it's too small and this is the second one I'm buying because I lost my first one while playing with my phone in bed and could not find it ever again. It's probably stuck in some sheets or the bed frame, I tried but can't seem to locate it anymore. I had just discovered and saved the cure to cancer on that card and I cannot remember what it was now. Sorry.",Positive,Positive

"I purchased 2 128GB SD cards, one for my Nokia Lumia 1520, and another for my Surface Pro 2, both devices took the card without any issues.As for read/Write speeds, I am sure there are better options, but this is the only 128GB Micro SD card available right now, and Sandisk did an amazing job with the product.And currently at $119.99(For how long, I am not sure), it's a great deal, considering a lot of the good SD cards are in the $140 range still.No issues with either card unmounting itself, put them in, transfer files, and you're good.",Positive,Positive
"I bought this for my grandson to use in his GoPro camera; he says it works great, and if he is happy, all is good.

"I purchased this Micro SD card to add storage to my Acer tablet. Unfortunately the tablet did not recognize the device.

"I'm a music lover and like to carry my entire music collection around with me everywhere I go. That being said it takes up A LOT of space, enough to fill a 64gb memory card on its own (a lot of the files are FLAC format.) I was a little hesitant to buy the 128gb card when it came out recently because with the 64gb cards the first batch were pretty much defective with resulted in a recall. Me, learning of the recall after looking up the issues I was having had to return the card I bought. SanDisk took the 64gb card back without hesitation and was actually prepared to do it without the serial number (since I couldn't open my phone at the time because the case is screwed on.)Note to everyone:Quite a few applications don't fully support NTFS or newer file system formats such as exFAT. To use your SD card without issues you have to format it to FAT32 which IS possible even though its over 32GB. Use the &#34;Fat32Format&#34; tool made by Ridgecrop Consultants, there's a GUI (Graphical User Interface) version available for those unfamiliar with using the command line.------After receiving my new card I formatted it to fat32 since I use a lot of applications that aren't the norm and it's easier to use an older file system that is compatible with everything made after 1996. The transfer of files and swapping of cards was seamless, my computer's micro-sd card reader recognized it without trouble as well as my phone. So far everything is good and there's been no hiccups. Even Google Play has been crashing less when trying to browse my music collection.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"I keep growing with these things as they grow in capacity and speed. This device, however, stands out above all the others microSD Cards I have used. I experienced an incredible and noticeable difference in speed between this and theSanDisk 32GB microSDHC Memory Card (Bulk Package)I have used in my phone for the last two years. Besides doubling the capacity from 32GB, I am enjoying the benefit of the speed this thing brings with it and adds to my phone. The price was really right for this too. I can only imagine what theSanDisk Extreme 64 GB microSDXC Class 10 UHS-I Memory Card with Adapter (SDSDQX-064G-U46A)is like. I was not yet willing to pay the price for it to find out.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"Picked up this memory card at a great price on a gold box deal. Reputable name, fast card. However, after several months of trying to get my phone to work with the card, formatted it, partitioned it. &#34;mounted&#34; the card, &#34;unmounted the card,&#34; all to no avail.  I realized that this memory card is not compatible with my Samsung SGH-T769 (Galaxy S 4G). No need to get frustrated and try a Sandisk &#34;Ultra&#34; 32GB Class 10 card in the phone. I replaced this card with a &#34;plain&#34; Sandisk 32GB Class 4 card in my phone, it was immediately recognized, formatted and mounted by the Samsung phone.YMMV",Negative,Negative
"I bought this to use as expanded storage in my Asus Transformer Book T100 but it was unstable and I have had to return it. Although the tablet would see the card when it was first inserted there would be errors trying to copy files onto it and then Windows would indicate that it needed formatting. If I tried a quick format then everything seemed to be OK but the instability would return as soon as I tried to copy data to the card. If I tried a full format it always failed.I gave it two starts because it seemed to work using the supplied SD adapter in a Windows 7 laptop. I was able to do a full format on that but, when I put it back into the tablet, the problems continued. The tablet is compatible with SDXC cards and, when I tried a different micro SD card in the tablet, it worked fine so I assume it was a problem with this card.",Negative,Negative
"I purchased this to expand the internal memory of my smart phone, specifically the Galaxy S3.  It performs absolutely flawlessly.  If you have any reservations about this micrSD...don't.

PLEASE, turn the phone off and remove the battery before installation...lol",Strongly Positive,Positive

"Love Sandisk, never had a problem with them and still have not. Popped this into my Samsung Galaxy Relay 4g running Android 4.0.4 and the phone detected it without a problem. Has the write speeds expected and gets the job done. Would recommend a different card if you plan to go to 64gb, buy the Samsung UHS-1 SDXC, writes at much higher speeds and has less lag. Would buy this again for the cheap price, fifty elsewhere.Sincerely, iSklcndykid",Strongly Positive,Positive
I purchased this memory card to use in my Samsung Galaxy S4 and it worked right out of the box. I haven't had any issues with it at all and the transfer speeds have been excellent. I would highly recommend this or the 64GB version to anyone looking to increase the storage capacity of your mobile phone.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"I bought this to go along with my new S4 that I purchased and I have to say I am pleasantly surprised at how much 32GB can get you on a phone!  I have pushed all of my apps to my SD card which has given me plenty of free room on my phone (a major detraction placed on the S4 especially).  I do notice that since moving most of my apps to the card, some load times and other features may take an extra second to really get going.  This may lead me towards going with more powerful SD cards in the future though I am assured this will work for all of my current needs.",Positive,Positive
Works great in my Verizon Samsung Galaxy S3. The only thing I found that didn't work was trying to transfer my files using a USB MicroSD card reader. When I used this USB Reader it copied my files but the phone didn't show them or couldn't write to the card. I had to put the microSDXC card in the phone and copy my files the slow way using the USB cable. The card does run hot when copying files to or from it. That would be normal I assume with it being Class 10. Best bang for the buck IMO. I would buy another one if I needed it!,Positive,Positive
Works great in my Motorola Atrix 4G.  Consistently reliable - never any problems.  Will definitely purchase SanDisk again in the future.  Keep up the great work!,Strongly Positive,Positive
"The SanDisk Ultra 64 GB is just a storage device, so I don't find that there will be many ""features"" to get excited about. That being said, it is advertised as having 30MB/s transfer speed, but this is misleading. It can READ up to 30 MB/s, however, and the packaging says this too; it writes at a slower rate. I used this for my phone (too much music) and had the stock 8 GB microSD that came with my phone. I had about 6.5 GB of data that I wanted to transfer back to my new microSD card, and this took about 30 minutes. If this were a strict transfer from my internal hard drive to an external it would be faster, but this is not such a connection. It lost a star because the transfer took so long, but in reality, I don't expect to be transferring 6 + GBs of data anytime soon so this problem will be minimal for me. Other than that it works great, and I have not had any issues with the formatting or reading.",Positive,Positive
"this card would not show 64 GB until i spent $60 on a card reader that supports sdxc, and after doing that, it is transferring at class 1 speed. i managed to get it formatted in FAT32 with 59 GB free for my Cowon J3, but it's taking 10 hours to transfer 30 GB to it. i got a refund because this is not the service and quality i paid for. i just hope the music lists on my PMP when i turn it on tomorrow. i have it in the microSDXC slot of the AFT PRO-57U, which is connected to a Syba VIA VL800 USB 3.0 card. feel free to tell me i am doing it wrong and how to get class 10 speed.UPDATE: the transfer finished, but the data does not show in my Cowon J3, so the early versions that worked are gone. do not buy these for a device that is not SDXC specific because they have changed something in them.",Strongly Negative,Negative
"I purchased this card for my parent's ASUS Transformer Tablet as a Christmas gift.  It installed with no issues and they love it.  I made the mistake of buying a no name SD card for my tablet (Motorola Xoom) previously and had to return it as my tablet didn't recognize it.  The SanDisk brand is excellent quality.  I guess it just goes to show you, you get what you pay for.  The Amazon price is good.  Never again will buy cheap for a memory card.",Strongly Positive,Positive

"I bought this memory card the day I received my Samsung Galaxy S4. It arrived in two days via Prime, plugged it in and formatted. It offers 59.45 GBs of usable space. Being that the card is Class 10, reads are super fast and writes are great. UHS-1 is, sadly, mostly only supported by DSLRs, so most smartphones and devices won't take advantage of the super, super speed, but nonetheless, the card is fast.This card has lots of storage, affordable, transfers and reads fast. I'd recommend this for people who carry a lot of media, such as music and videos.",Strongly Positive,Positive
This Micro SD card works great. I even formatted it to FAT32 to use in my car for my TV headunit and have had no issues. Plus when i bought it it was down to 34.99 from 50.00. Great deal.

This super micro SD card was required for the Sony Action Cam that I bought for use with my Phantom quad copter. Super small and therefore easy to misplace. I like my CF cards I use for my cameras because you can hold on to them better. I like sandisk products as that's all I use.,Positive,Positive

I had an old Class 4 Kingston card in my phone and the thing just dragged when transferring music or photos. I finally decided I had enough with Class 4 and went looking for a reliable Class 10 card.

This is the real deal. There are fakes out there and this is NOT one of them. This shipped directly from SanDisk Corporation! When purchasing from Amazon and the seller is different you never know what you may receive and they (the seller) are not always aware of fakes so you have to contact SanDisk to provide the serial code number off the card or send a pic to them so they may authenticate it. It's nice to not have to do that for a change! Checked the partition and it's correct. Also confirmed this card ir read by LG Optimus G Pro on AT&T network.,Strongly Positive,Positive

Kicker not to my favoris you only have about 2 months to return this card for a full refund.Then, it's a pro rated rated deal when you send it back to Amamzon inLexington, KY.The failed card was in a GoPro White Edition. Needless to say, a camera thatwas purchased for summer outdoor usage in November is going to sit for quite awhile before you have time to get your money back.  Card sat all winter and failedtowards the end of April.  6 months lag to get a decent, even pro rated refund.Out of all the items I bought from Amazon this is my only bad experience.64 gigs crammed on a tiny micro SD card is too much.  I'll stick with thesmaller 32 gigs until this technology is meant to last.Refund Update, once again Amazon did the right thing anbd refunded full purchase pricefor the dead 64 gig.  Amazon is where I shop for 2 reasons.  1.

"After purchasing three of these (one for myself and two for gifts to others) I read reviews that said they sometimes just quit, and it's difficult or impossible to recover data.  I have only been using my own card for 2-3 weeks, but it hasn't failed yet.3/27/13 after having this in my phone for almost 4 months, the phone started chirping every few seconds, telling me it was either mounting or unmounting a card.  The SanDisk Ultra 32 GB MicroSDHC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card apparently just decided to fail.  Thank goodness I only had info for one small app on it, and only need to access it about once a week, so it's not real critical.  Thanks to Amazon's 30 day return policy though, I will probably just have to eat the cost of this one.  Unfortunately, I read the other bad reviews about this product after I had already purchased mine (2 of them, but my wife's hasn't failed YET).

"It reaches read speed of about 24MB/s and write speed of about 18MB/s at optimal situation.Other than the speed, everything is fine. I'd like to say the color is quite a good thing, because MicroSD could be so small that you put it away for a few seconds it will easily disappear. With the bright read and light grey color, it is much easier to find, because it will not blend into common background.Also, the quality looks good, not like some of the MicroSD cards, this is a ""unibody"" design that you cannot tell from appearance that where is the circuits. The SD card adapter come with it is in quite good quality too.In summery, good design, good quality, not too satisfying speed. It will be a judgement call to say if it worth it or not.

But the hassle of having to return it isn't worth the $10 you may save.",Strongly Negative,Negative
"When I needed more VIDEO capacity for my Canon camera, the Sandisk 32 GB Micro Card (with included Adapter) was EXACTLY the right tool for the job !!I've had several SanDisk Memory Cards in the past, with never a glitch of any kind.Highly recommended !",Strongly Positive,Positive
"The micro SD card was extremely fast.  Writing and read files were very fast even on a slow USB 2.0 interface.  Mechanically, the card is tight in the adapter.  Needs a screw driver to get it back out of the adapter.  Tried on another two adapters with the same results, tight fit.  If user plan to use this as a normal size SD card, it is an excellent card.  If one plan to switch between &#34;phone&#34; (micro SD card) and camera (normal size SD card), then the tight fit might be a problem.  Vender service was excellent.  shipment was faster than expected.  Would buy it again even with the tight fit.  It was an excellent value for a very fast card (camera can shoot burst mode without slowing down to write to card).",Positive,Positive
I had to replace my other 32G MSD Card. Was not aware of the Card Speed issue and as a result started loosing video and pics from the card as they became corrupted. Did a little research and found out the card write speed was the issue. Did not make sense. But replaced the card and yes it works. Have not lost a pic or a vid since.,Positive,Positive
Ordered several of these as they are much cheaper then at Best Buy. Use in my GoPro and they work great. I prefer several 32GBs over 64GBs just in case they do get corrupted you aren't losing as much data.,Strongly Positive,Positive
Great memory card! Got this on one Amazon's daily deals at a terrific price! Getting ready to upgrade my cell phone and want to have a larger capacity memory card ready to go. This is just what I needed!,Strongly Positive,Positive
"The card was working great. I own quite a few for several of my devices. One that I bough in 2012 suddenly died. I went to the SanDisk website and did a chat support. The Tech tried some quick troubleshooting and after about five minutes asked for my info for an RMA. The process was quick and easy. Like I said, this one suddenly died, no idea why. Luckily I didn't have anything important on it at the time. This is the only one I've ever had fail, and like I said, the RMA process was a breeze. I really like these cards and the customer service was great. For reference, I run these cards in a Samsung Galaxy SII (hercules) - 32 gb, Motorola Droid (sholes) - 16 gb, Motorola Droid 3 (solana) - 32 gb, Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 (2012) (GT-N8013) -32 gb, it was the Note one that failed. I also have a GoPro but I run the golden SanDisk cards in that, but they are twice the price! I will continue to buy these cards regardless of this isolated incident.",Positive,Positive
"We always come straight to Amazon for our memory card needs, and SanDisk is one of the reliable names in this category.  Lots of usable memory for minimum cost outlay so there is no downside to this product. Max out storage on your compatible devices!",Strongly Positive,Positive
This is the best Class 10 MicroSD card I own. I have compared it to my other cards and it out performs all other cards I have. It came with a SD to microSD card converter which is a nice plus. This card come pre-formatted to work with Android devices and Windows devices. Can't get much easier than that.Great card + fast shipping = no complaints,Strongly Positive,Positive
"Before purchasing this I had a SanDisk 16GB Class 2 microSDHC. Needless to say, I didn't see the need in purchasing one of these. Then I began to read how Class 10 cards really do process recordings faster and records pictures faster. I didn't believe it, so I put it to the test. Using it in my Samsung Galaxy sIII, I installed it and recorded videos, took pictures, and played music on it. I also downloaded PDFs for work and other documents to it. In every test, it was far faster than any other class, and you can tell a difference between the classes. To close, I would just say don't settle for a lower class because it's cheaper. Wait for these to go on sale (because you know as well as I do that they will) and purchase one then. There is no reason to get a card in a lower class.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"I've only had this Memory card for 3.5 weeks and it not only has recently started resetting, it intermittently loses contact with my Cell phone and the memory is lost, erasing everything on it!!!!!! Now I find out my return date has past and I'm stuck with a peice of s*** memory card that I can't do a damn thing about! Thanks a lot for nothing! I will never buy direct from here again!Also, I didn't realize I was supposed to have an adapter too? wow where the heck is that at???",Strongly Negative,Negative
"This card does not work on droid razr phones. Whenever I try to transfer files on the card, it makes the phone freeze completely. I have tried every possibility to get this to work, but this type of card is worthless because it does not work due to its high capacity on phones. Every workaround I have tried to get this card to work, it still causes my phone to freeze.",Strongly Negative,Negative
"I bought one of the 32GB for my Galaxy S4, and another for my Canon T3i. It works no problem in it, detected and formatted out of the box.  SanDisk is one of the most reliable card manufacturers in my opinion. I've gone through and sold a lot of cheap/lesser SD cards throughout the years, and almost all manufacturer has their failures, but to date I haven't had any issues with SanDisk. I've bought this same card for my wife and family members (everyone has the S4), and so far there's been no issues. I use mine heavily everyday, new music and movies, and after 6-9 months haven't had any failures.As far as speed goes, using `dd` on a USB3 card reader I recorded almost 14MB/s write speed and 33MB/s read speed. Making it by far the fastest Class 10 card I've had. They do sell &#34;Extreme&#34; versions of this card which are even faster, but most integrated devices won't see the speed increase benefits.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"I bought this card for my new Samsung Galaxy Note 3, didn't have to do anything but put the card in the phone, no formatting needed. Transferred all of my pictures and a few videos along with about 15 GB of music everything loaded very quickly and I still have a ton of memory left to store whatever I want or need to. Bought this on Amazon at a much better price than I could find anywhere else. I ordered this with Amazons frustration free packaging, just pull the tab on the package and the card is in your hand in less than ten seconds. Recommend for anyone who wants a fast card and a lot of memory.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"I bought this item based off other reviews and recommendations. Installation was extremely easy, and both cards (I bought 2) were shipped in perfect condition. Like others have noted: actual added storage is just over 29 GB. Buying via Amazon was a huge discount as opposed to local in-store options.Shipping was perfect. I would recommend this product to friends/family.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"This card is fast! And cheap!  I used it on my Canon S100 Camera to shoot raw format pictures and 1080 video and it worked flawlessly.  I'm currently using it on my old Mytouch phone for storage.Great product, great price.",Strongly Positive,Positive
It work great in my Asus Tablet for 3 months then it just completely died. It was not recognized by any of my devices. It had just died.I have RMA'd it to Sandisk. The prcess was painless and my replacement should arrive within a few days. They emailed me a return label thru UPS and sent it off last week.When it worked the performance was great and access times were very fast. No lag in reading and writing data.If you get this just make sure you have a back up of your data incase of failure. Had my Tablet synced to my cloud service so I did not lose anything. I have purchased other Sandisk items and have never had a issue.,Positive,Positive
"This card worked in my Galaxy S3 right off the bat.  I did not need to format it or anything.  After about 2 weeks, I was watching a video on my phone and it locked up.  Then the phone showed that the card was damaged.  Now I am unable to copy anything over 100mb to or from the card.  Viewing photos from the gallery also locks up the phone.  Amazon customer service is great, however.  They sent me a new card.  I will update my review after I am able to use the new one for at least a month without any errors.****UPDATE****After having the second card for a few weeks, it also had the same issues.  Even worse, the card was completely unreadable after it locked up.  The card showed about 5 GB of data being used, but could not be accessed via the phone or in a computer.  Sent this one back and will be going back to my trusty 16GB card.",Strongly Negative,Negative
"I bought this for my new camera, and the price is incredible. I am a big fan of SanDisk when it comes to memory cards, so of course, I bought one for my camera, but was unsure about it fitting in my new camera (Samsung wb30f). Turns out, it fits, and the storage capacity is incredible. I am a picture lover, so whenever I am able to take pictures, I do. This gave me over 4,000 pictures (maybe even more, I can't remember). Great price, great storage capacity... can't go wrong",Strongly Positive,Positive
"No issues, plug and play.I have not run benchmarks, but I do store all of my camera and video data to the card. This includes a lot of high definition Daily Roads dashboard cam footage. There's no issues caching all of the temp video files, or storing the ones I opt to save due to the apparently speed and capacity of this card.The only con is the fact I waited so long to buy one. :)",Strongly Positive,Positive
"Arrived DOA but Amazon sent me another one right away and it is perfect. I use it with my GoPro HERO 3 and it is a must if shooting 1440 or better video in order to keep up.Do you need 64gb? Maybe, maybe not but you do need Class 10 so buy it and never look back!",Positive,Positive
True to its name! Sandisk is the best! I am only using this for my smartphone so I guess it's overkill! Many said this type of micro SD card is meant for DSLR's. I'm going for quality and something that would last a long time. That's why I went for this. Highly recommended!,Strongly Positive,Positive
it is amazing how much storage they can fit into such a small form factorremember 1.5 mb floppy disks ?heck this thing is soooo small you might lose itits like pinky nail size smalland holds 64 GB ! awesome,Strongly Positive,Positive
SanDisk is a great brand and it has failed. I have purchased several of these so I think it was just bad luck. I am sure Amazon will replace it.,Negative,Negative
"I have a dashcam.  It didn't come with a memory card so I got this.This card has been working well in a fairly demanding capacity.  That's because like the way most drivers use dashcams, I've got mine set to 10 minute loops.  That means new data is being written over and over again on this card.  So far the card hasn't quit on me and I'm pleased.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"If you carry two of these, one in your camera and one in the camera case pocket (don't lose it), you will never run out of memory. Enough capacity at ~4MB/image to shoot and shoot and shoot.  Download at the end of the day if you want, but you have thousands of pictures on one of these. Couple with batteries (see WASABI review) and you can just never stop shooting.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"This is very good memory for GoPro. Went with 32GB because my brother, who has two GoPro cameras, said he never filled up his 32 so why go for 64? Anyway, this is versatile enough to go in phone or camera, I ordered two more.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"Gets the job done for my GoPro so that's good. I just never liked how small the actual card is due to its nature of it might just get lost...then that's game over. The price was amazing, so I got two for the price of half of one.",Positive,Positive
"I own a couple of these and I've tested them on several devices.  I use these cards mainly for my mobile devices.  The 64 gb has performed well on my galaxy note 2 and galaxy note 3.  I've tested the transfer rates and they are within the prescribed range.  These are not the fastest class 10 cards, but they are sufficient for storing pictures, movies, and songs. I'm able to play songs and movies off of the card without any delay at all.",Positive,Positive
Installed it to my Galaxy S4. Works great!I want more.. waiting for price to go down.. and I wish 128GB comes out soon so I can buy it,Strongly Positive,Positive
"This card is pretty cheap for how tiny (physically) and large (digitally) it is - at least in mid 2014. I got it to extend the storage capacity of my Surface Pro 3, and it has done just that. I can store files on it so that I don't have to take up precious space that can be dedicated towards programs since the Surface Pro 3 has a full Windows 8 on it. It also doubles as a storage device for my GoPro Hero 3 Black, but I have a faster card for it to prevent the freezing issue. The size of this micro SD card just does a great job in storing data like videos, photos, and music. It fits in most devices that are moving to Micro SDXC, such as phones, tablets, and my beloved Surface Pro 3. I highly recommend this card if you just need to extend the storage of your device. Reconsider a faster card if you want to record video straight to it, like with a GoPro.",Positive,Positive
"I bought this to be able to load more music into my Verizon LG Android phone. I spent hours adding music to the card. Then, I put it into my Android phone. The phone did not read anything on the memory card. The other memory cards, 8GB and 32GB worked fine, so it must be a flaw in this memory card. Also, this memory card got stuck in my Android phone's slot. I had to use a utility knife with a very, very thin blade to pull out this card.",Strongly Negative,Negative
There are things that I would like to say about the sand disk ultra.It is the best dang SD card I've ever used.  All rights so let's be honest I just put this in my phone so that I would have extra storage for photos and videos.However it is really good because it just sits in my phone and I don't have to do anything about it.Seriously I can access everything by Just connecting my phone to USB so it is essentially like the phone has another hard drive.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"I love this memory card!! I upgraded the memory on my phone from a 2gb stock card to this and, not only are the transfer rates from card to phone and back WAY faster, but the capacity is great!! I've now replaced my iPod with this because I can have all of my music on my phone as well as any games and I don't have to use iTunes to interface, just drag and drop. Oh, and it's waterproof. Like my phone. Just saying.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"This brand has proven to be reliable and easy to work with. It is versatile for use in my Android devices as well as cameras. Nothing is permanent and I try to have a back up of my files, but it has served me well for a couple of years.",Strongly Positive,Positive
Ordered this one because my 2GB finally wasn't enough storage and I thought I could use the extra GB for future use. SD card is legit and does very well! Definitely recommended.,Strongly Positive,Positive
The 32 gig San Disk memory card went into a tablet given as a Christmas gift.No problems and fast performance.I loaded all the music and some video that was stored in a laptop.I still have 12 gigs left.Very happy with the memory unit.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"I'm not a techie, so I can't do all those great experiments to determine whether or not the transfer speed is as advertised. All I know is, the card works just fine in my Galaxy S3. So far, it has worked great, and seems to be pretty speedy.I have San Disk cards in quite a few of my tech toys, and they've always performed well. I am confident that this one will do the same.",Positive,Positive
"There's a lot of counterfeits on these, and I apparently picked up a bum card from MemoryWhiz. My device shows me there's a 32gb of space there; it just is impossible to gain access to it. Rather, the /sdcard folder is found on my device's internal memory (the memory that came with the device). I even downloaded some apps that were supposed to read and write from my SDCard, but they work even when I unmount the card and remove it. So check out these cards thoroughly when you buy them and make sure they're what they say they are. Naturally, SanDisk isn't going to stand by a counterfeit.",Strongly Negative,Negative
"SOOOO pleased with this little dude.  I actually bought 2 of these - a 32GB and a 16GB for 2 MEEPS that are Christmas gifts, which, BTW, is about the coolest little tablet for little kids as it does it all - books, movies, games, internet, etc - all parentally controlled via cloud!!!  The MEEP has adaquate memory to a degree like all other handheld devices, however, if you want to store a lot games/movies/books on the MEEP you need an extra memory card and this is THE card to buy.  This 32GB was bought to go into a MEEP for the 4 year old and I don't know if she needed a Class 10, but for the low price of this SanDisk, why not?  I highly recommend this little card and the MEEP it went in - both are absolutely worth every penny.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"Works great in the Samsung Galaxy S3 phone. I purchased one for my phone and one for my son's phone and they both work great! We've had no problems with either card. My son loves that he was able to put his whole music library, several translator apps and bible versions, along with several movies on his phone to take with him on a mission trip to Peru and still had room to store thousands of photos he took while there. Being able to use a card like this is one of the main reasons I switched from an iPhone to an S3. Love it!",Strongly Positive,Positive
"I've never had an issue with sandisk memory cards, and likewise.  Great price for what you're getting, memory is getting cheaper, and speed isn't a huge issue for me for smartphone use, so this was ideal.  Can never go wrong with sandisk.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"This has really just been used to store some extra files and pass between computers. It came with the converter to change it to a standard SD card. No issues with either. It always amazes me how so much data can be stored in such a small space. Anyway, it will get more use in the next month. I'm planning on upgrading phones and will knock it down a star if it seems to slow to record video to. So if you just see 5 stars, it means I am lazy and the disk is still good.",Positive,Positive
The microsd is faster that most and is very reliable. I can now hold all my music on my phone. The warranty is also decent on this card. I would recommend it to anyone especially at this great price.,Strongly Positive,Positive
Pros:Maximum external storage for my SGS3.Plenty of space on my phone now to store music and pictures.Fast data transfer.Cons:none.Other:Shipped super fast (think i actually got it next day) packaged well.,Strongly Positive,Positive
I was using a basic memory card in my Samsung Note 3 and when I took a picture it took forever for the phone to put it in the memory card and get ready for a new picture. Once I installed this Sandisk the transfer was almost non-existent. What a difference. Worth the few extra bucks.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"I would not recommend this card if your looking for REAL class 10 write speeds. The most I could get is 9mb/s from this card but for the most part it was about 7-8mb/s. I even did a slow format to exfat in windows 7 with no improvements. I copied over music, pics and movies to test it out ranging from a couple of mb to over a gb. The read speeds were pretty good at around 21mb/s though. I popped in a 32gb class 10 transcend SD card and it consistently got 16-18mb/s write speeds and 24mb/s read speeds. So in conclusion I think this card is not really a class 10. Too bad I read all the negative 1 star reviews after the fact but I will be sending this one back.",Negative,Negative
"Of late, Sandisk appears to have lost their way a little with their flash storage products. It's almost a universal truth that all of their USB flash drives are hopelessly slow; while they're usually reliable, transfer rates of 4MB/sec or less are worthless when filling a 32GB drive. Fortunately, their ""Ultra"" line of SD cards still appears to buck this trend.Formatted as NTFS and used in anelago Mobile Nano II reader, I see write speeds on a 64-bit Linux machine at a consistent 15-16MB/sec when copying large (1GB or larger) files to this card, which more than lives up to its class 10 billing. Reads appear to run at about 19-20MB/sec.I can't comment on reliability as I've only had the card a few days, but everything I've copied so far for testing has made it onto the card (and off again) with no corruption whatsoever; the MD5 checksum of every file I've transferred matches the source. That's more than can be said for the Supertalent Pico USB drive that this SD card and reader are intended to replace, which has never been quite right (it's always occasionally randomly corrupted files of larger than 100MB or so, and the probability of 1GB or greater files surviving was near zero).32GB appears to be the sweet spot at the moment; smaller cards don't cost that much less, and larger cards are beyond the SDHC spec and into SDXC territory, which isn't yet universal in terms of device compatibility (not to mention they cost far more than double for 64GB).For what I paid for this around Thanksgiving (not part of any explicit sale, but definitely a lower price than appears usual as far as camelcamelcamel is concerned) I'm extremely satisfied.Edit: I should also mention that the included mechanical full-size SD adaptor is one of the worst I've ever encountered. There's a lot of friction when the microSD card is inserted, and it's a right bugger to get it out of the adaptor again. Thankfully I have a few other such adaptors lying around should I ever need one; this one's going in the bin.",Positive,Positive
Works as it should. i use it with my GoPro HERO 3+ and I have not had any issues. Holds tons of footage. I have 4 of these and it is overkill but they were so cheap that why not. Better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it.,Strongly Positive,Positive
I used this card to replace the hard disk in my old laptop so I can use it to stream netflix. I installed linux Ubuntu on it. The card works great. It's very fast and is very reliable. I recommend it.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"I love the ultras cause it writes fast to the card with my samsung S3 with not much time in between pics.  I also got one for my Fuji waterproof camera and it takes a few seconds before I can take another photo but that is the limitation of the processor of the camera, not the card. Overall, I love it.  My computer can read them fast and videos are played back at real speed",Strongly Positive,Positive
I used it with my Samsung S4 and it works great. I bring a lot of music and movies with me when I travel and it is great that I don't have to bring an entire hard drive or extra memory cards that can be misplaced. Totally worth the money.,Strongly Positive,Positive
Excellent price for the amount of storage and speed. I just washed this in the washing machine and was preparing to buy another. After checking it for errors it came up with none. Needless to say I don't have to buy another but did feel compelled to write a review. Cheers!,Strongly Positive,Positive
Price was great on Amazon and now even better.  Have the chip in my phone and it appears to work great.....fast and so far no errors have been encountered.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"SanDisk makes great products and this one's just another of them.  I'm using it in a vehicle dash camera to record HD .mov format video and on my shakedown run the camera and the disc worked perfectly together!  32gb of space gives me plenty of room to record, and the Class 10 rating means the card is plenty fast enough to keep up and produce crisp and clear video.  Color was also good.",Strongly Positive,Positive

"Alot of storage for a great price. Only one probkem: since I installed this card into my Samsung Galaxy Note 3, about once a month or so, when I turn the phone on in the morning it gets stuck in some sort of &#34;boot loop&#34; and hangs on the AT&T logo screen. My phone is stock, and I have altered the software in no way. Granted, I cannot be sure that the card is the cause of this problem, but if I remove it and then boot the phone, it works properly. I love SanDisk products, and I will definitely continue to buy them. Just a word of warning.",Negative,Negative
"I have had cheaper SD Cards in the past, but they almost always wound up letting me down. I made up my mind some time ago that I would stick with SanDisk and have been completely satisfied with all my cards from them ever since. This card sits in my wife's phone and is used to store all her music and pictures. It has been in & out close to a dozen times (because I like to fiddle with stuff) and as proven very durable.In case anyone wants to know, &#34;Class 10&#34; is the only way to go with these cards (until they come out with something faster), the read/write speed is well worth the few extra bucks for my needs.I also have a &#34;Class 10&#34; 64 GB in my Galaxy SIII and it's as good or better. I even got it wet (I mean soaked) and it is still working like a charm.I will definitely recommend this to anyone, and will be sticking with SanDisk for all my other devices.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"My wife and I just upgraded our phone to Note 3 and wanted more space.  We had the phone for 4 days now and Micro SD card works fine.  However, I feel transfer rate is slow when transfering movies from my desktop to SD card.  1.2GB movie will take about 12-16 minutes.  I have pretty high end gaming PC.  Intel I7 980X CPU, 12GB Memory, 7870 ATI Graphic card, 120GB SSD card, 3TB hard drive for storage, 1200W 80Plus Gold PUS, ASUS Sabortooth motherboard,etc.  When transfering movies or file to my WD 2.5 inch external hard drive will take 1-2 minutes.

"Purchased this to drop into my Galaxy Note II. Exactly what I wanted.Loaded up the entirety of the card in about 18 minutes, which is not super fast, but very good considering the card was in the phone instead of in the computer using the include adapter.I purchased this product with the worry-free packaging and was for the first time not frustrated with SanDisk.The Super Saver Shipping really sold the deal to me.The price now is on par with most retailers, but I got two Duds from BestBuy and was good to go with the first one from Amazon, doesn't really say much about the product, but gives you a bit of peace of mind when purchasing from this vendor.",Positive,Positive
"Before doing research, i assumed this card would support my brand new Hero 3 camera... considering it was sold off the Gopro site, it was a no brainer... or so i thought.Anyhow, the card seems to preform well under most circumstances WITHOUT using the Protunes settings. (The problems with the Hero 3 where due to the slow write speed of this card under Protunes settings, without this setting the Hero works fine)However, after a few timelapse issues (2 - 5 sec timelapse, which is well in this card's speeds).I noticed the card is corrupt. I tested this in other cameras and found that this problem still persists. I trust Sandisk as my top choice for all my professional work, however this card has failed!I would not recommend this EXPENSIVE card, id jump for a Samsung, or even the Transcend cards. They even come with a better warranty then this card.Nothing but problems and lost memories that i cant replace....",Strongly Negative,Negative
"Item arrived in time as promised. Works well with a galaxy note 10.1. There is nothing more to say about this product as it has been reviewed so many times. It works well, not a bad price at the time of ordering ( now it has come down ). Yes, you get the same card for lesser price from other sellers but I trust amazon for their customer service issues. I prefer to pay 2 bucks more and get it from amazon rather than getting it from unfamiliar sellers.",Positive,Positive

"As soon as I saw that this card was announced on the various tech sites out there, I knew that I had to buy one.  I went to Amazon and picked one up for $120.  This is a steep price compared to 64gb cards, but this is the largest capacity commercially available.  And I don't want to be swapping out micro SD cards.  That is just so inconvenient.  I did various speed tests on this card and can confirm that you can get 30MB/s+ read speed.  Fastest I saw was a little over 40MB/s.  Write speed varied greatly and seemed to decrease the larger the file got.  Minimum write speed i saw was just under 10 MB/s.  I use this on my Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and have not have any issues with it.",Positive,Positive
Use this card for my slr. Works fantastic and allows me to use burst mode to its full capacity (10fps)...

"Bought this card for my Galaxy S4 and after installing it and loading my music, the card was randomly ejecting itself. After like the 3rd ejection of the morning, the phone reported that the card needed to be reformatted because it was damaged, so I reformatted. The random SDCard ejection and Damaged card kept coming up. After googling, I read that the Galaxy series phones are known to have compatibility issues with SanDisk cards and its a hit or miss, some phones have no issues. I have replaced this card already, which Amazon, shipped me a 2nd card within a few days, but the same problems arise. Not sure if I should switch to a different brand, but this card is definitely useless to me for the time being. Maybe I can give it away to a friend who doesn't have an S4. :/",Strongly Negative,Negative

"I have this card in my Samsung Galaxy III.It has been in there now for about 8 months with no issues.Okay, it had one issue but that was the phone design itself. It would un-mount if the phone was moved around roughly. It seems to pop out very easy in the Samsung Galaxy phones. So I solved the problem by putting some electrical tape on it to hold it in. So far after 8 months it hasn't un-mounted.It will give you an ungodly amount of storage on this phone. If your wondering if your Samsung Phone will take this card - it will with no issues. It shows a total of 59.6 GB of available space once installed. A must have since most phones come with 8 GB of internal memory nowadays.",Strongly Positive,Positive

"Bought both this and a similar Transcend Premium 300X 32 GB MicroSDHC Class 10 UHS for a couple of G1WH dash cams.  Both work well with the cameras.  The key is you need cards compliant with UHS 1 or better.  Look for the U with a 1 or a 3 inside it on the card for these cameras.  The Transcend is rated slightly faster but the cameras seem to like either equally well.  When I purchased this Transcend and the SanDisk were within pennies of each other, so aside from slight price and speed differences, there's not much to recommend one over the other.  And so long as you get at least a UHS 1 card, the same can be said for other manufacturers such as G.Skill, Kingston, or others.",Neutral,Neutral
"Gave it 4 stars because I don't know if the problem is the card or the phone.  I have an intermittant problem where the phone stops recognizing it.  But it's fast, and holds a lot.  I would recommend it.Update:  Had intermittant issues with my phone (galaxy s3).  Finally gave up the ghost completely, computer won't recognize it at all.  I don't think I had any important data on it.  I would take it up with SanDisk, as another reviewer indicated that they replaced his over issues in his phone, but my computer can't even recognize it to wipe it so I'm not sending it anywhere.",Negative,Negative

"Great card, great price...can't really beat SanDisk. The brand has never let me down and is well built.  I use this on a Mobius Action Camera and it works wonders.  It also has worked well on my GoPro Hero3+ Silver.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"I bought this card because I have several devices that use microSD cards, but not all of them are compatible with the newer and higher-capacity SDXC standard. For SDHC memory cards, 32GB is the largest size available under that technology standard, so I went with this one from Sandisk. That way I didn't have to worry about compatibility issues with any of my devices. I've used Sandisk memory products for a number of years along with many other brands, and I've always had good results from them. I'm happy to say that my experience with this card echoes that of 5,000+ other Amazon users; it's been rock steady, reliable with larger file transfers (several 2GB+ movies at a time), and performed as quickly as I'd hoped for a Class 10 card in regards to its read/write times.Aside from the existing reviews and my previous experiences with Sandisk products, I also picked up this particular card due to its UHS-1 compliance. I don't currently have any UHS-1 devices that can take advantage of the increased speed, but for the negligible cost difference, it just made sense. Standards and technology update so fast these days; any future-proofing a product can provide to extend its usable life is always appreciated.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"This is called &#34;Class 10&#34;, so I ordered it, figuring it would have useable speed. I plugged it in to copy about 9GB of program installation files. I was totally dumbfounded that it took about 3 hours to copy those files onto this &#34;Ultra&#34; &#34;Class 10&#34; SDXC card. (9GB on my super-slow, super-cheap plastic school-kid USB thumb drive takes less than 10 minutes.) So then I tested it on various known computers with typical raw and JPG picture files. Read speeds ranged from 15-25MB/s, while write speeds ranged from 4-8MB/sec for big files, and below 1MB/sec for small files. This is what I would call largely unusable. VERY disappointing.",Strongly Negative,Negative
"I was very excited to add this memory card to my G2 and finally not have to worry about used up memory anymore. This was short lived however as maybe a few months had passed when the memory card refused to write anymore data. I tried formatting it (never could wipe it), using it in a thumb drive reader kwpould not delete data), all to no avail. Luckily the data I had on it was still salvageable.",Strongly Negative,Negative

It's a good capacity but the speed is slow that is almost 10M...but it's acceptable to me. I like it.,Positive,Positive
As advertised. Good write and read speeds and works well with new Microsoft surface. Only complaint is there was a significant price drop after I purchased this card. But that's not amazons fault nor the product.,Positive,Positive

"The first one i received died in less than 2 months. It just stopped reading (lost all that was on the card), but Sandisk customer service was excellent and replaced it.

"I bought this card when I got my Note 2 back in October, it is perfect and fast.  No problems in any way and fully compatible with my device.UPDATE 1/15/14: I bought a second card for my Note 3 and it it excellent.  The frustration free packaging was much appreciated from the other packing last year.  My first original card got corrupted when I put it in an old feature phone but I am confident it had nothing to do with the card in any way.  I have tested these cards with the Galaxy Note 2, Note 3, Note 10.1 2014 and Tab 3 7"" and they all read the card no problem.  I have been extremely satisfied so far.",Strongly Positive,Positive
I recently upgraded from a nearly three-year-old HTC Windows Phone to a Samsung Galaxy S4 and decided to give it a huge memory boost. This card filled the bill perfectly. Add a good file manager to your App collection so you can use it effectively. Recommended.,Strongly Positive,Positive

"Although Amazon claim it is a C10 ultra fast Memory Card, it actually has much slower write speed than other C10 microSD card (it only scores about 60% of the normal speed). For example, I have tested it against my old Maxell C10 HC microSD card. The test was done by writing the same 3035MB random data from DRAM to empty microSD card through a USB3 card reader. The resulting time was the average value from 3 tests of each device:SanDisk Ultra 32GB C10/UHS1: 5m50.816s means 8.7MB/sMaxell C10 HC: 3m38.787s means 13.9MB/sThe speed is completely unacceptable for a Class-10 claim (13% lower than 10MB/s, the lowest boundary of Class-10 device), even the over-advertisement of SD card speeds are common (claiming 30MB/s for actual 12-15MB/s). It is almost a scam. Some Class-6 card will beat this ""Class-10"" card.",Strongly Negative,Negative
I use this in my HTC and it works like a champ.  Perfect for high definition videos and music for any smart phone.  Transfer rate is impressive and the price is right where it should be..,Strongly Positive,Positive
"Works fine, as SanDisk usually does. I know there's a lot of discussion about transfer rates and so forth, but I'm fine if the rate isn't so fast or slow. I really don't care, long as it holds and keeps the data until I can transfer it. All these cards seem to me to be about the same. SanDisk is the big name and so I usually stick with it. But I have other makes that are just as good.",Positive,Positive
"I had the card about 3 months in my Galaxy S 4 and then it suddenly went into a read only mode. All the data was still there and I was able to copy it all from the card but could not write or format the card. I searched the internet high and low for a solution and then finally contacted Sandisk support. After explaining my problem, they said it will need to be replaced and it would be covered under warranty. The replacement process took about two weeks, they paid for return shipping. I now have the 2nd card and have had it running for about 2 weeks now.We'll see if I just happened to get a bad one or if they all are of questionable quality.",Negative,Negative
I wanted some extra space in my new mobile device so I chose this SanDisk microSD card.  The card has worked perfect so far in my HTC One M8 for several weeks so far.  The performance of copying files from my computer over to the phone is adequate.  The performance is likely limited by the phone's USB 2.0 interface so I haven't done any tests with the card connected up to a dedicated SD card reader.,Positive,Positive
exactly as described and works GREAT on our Surface Pro's.  Excellent product!  Have never lost any data on one.  TARDIS,Strongly Positive,Positive
"Good size card and a great price. My only complaint is with the adapter card. The little lip on the end of the micro card is almost nonexistent and the adapter card slot is very, very tight.

"I bought two cards for tablets.  The first wouldn't format, so I bought another GSkill Class 10. The second worked, but only for 3-5 minutes. Then error, or freeze.  I thought it may have been the tablets.  However, the Gskill worked in both.....So I called Amazon.  The customer service was excellent.  There ""may"" have been a problem with one of their vendors......They shipped out two new cards with Saturday delivery.  It was ""implied"" through lengthy conversation with the Amazon Agent, that there were numerous problems with a particular company/vendor.Lesson:  Do NOT Hesitate To Call And Return if you get a card that seems to have ANY troubles out of the pack.I was surprised that my initial review was removed  from Amazon....So I am leaving another about the return.  II tried everything to fix these cards: fat32 ntfs and the newest exFat.....  There are definitely some damaged cards out there so be wary, and do not hesitate to call customer service!",Negative,Negative
Great item. Runs a lot faster then the cheap ones and still a really good price. Worth the extra money,Strongly Positive,Positive
"I bought this to put in my Olympus PEN E-PM1 camera which takes a standard SD card. Therefore it must go into the adapter to be put into the camera.  Unfortunately there is something touchy about this. Sometimes I turn the camera on and get a card error. Sometimes I can pop the card out and back in and it'll work. This past weekend I couldn't get it to work at all.  I'm guessing it's the camera. Or maybe the adapter?  When I plugged the card and adapter into my computer to copy the pictures off, it worked perfectly. So I'm not sure what the problem is. I make sure to always carry a spare ""normal"" SD card with my camera in case this one stops working.",Negative,Negative
"Seems like a good value, but as yet i've not gotten to actually use mine;I bought it for a Contour+ camera without realizing that was apparently known to be incompatible. Found that out afterward on Contour's forum. The device itself will support microSD up to 64GB but there is something about Sandisk Ultras that doesn't play nicely. Unclear what, exactlySo I'm sure it's great, but you might want to check around to make sure your device will support the thing.",Neutral,Neutral
SanDisk makes a great big little card. I have this in my HTC sensation 4G ( which it isn't supposed to work in ) and I got the full memory card working. It's great to be able to cary that mush memory on a phone.,Strongly Positive,Positive
Great product as promised. Slipped right into my Samsung Galaxy S4 with no issues and I like the adapter they provided in case I want to load data from my laptop directly into the card.

Completely error free and no issues whatsoever",Strongly Positive,Positive
I have lost my data 3 times with this card. I don't know if it's the card or the S3. My data always ends up as unrecoverable pieces in the LOST.DIR directory the phone creates the first time you insert the card.

I have an older generation SanDisk 32GB card I bough in 2011 and this one is a lot faster!The red stripe design also make it stand out visually very nicely.

It is a 'type 6' and I didn't realize that it could degrade the cam's performance. After reading in an online forum that &#34;any video or photo application will benefit greatly from a 'type 10' memory card&#34;, I ordered the SanDisk 16gb Type 10 Micro SD card. Wow! what a difference! The stuttering video that I thought was just inherent to the camera itself is now gone.

"Only had it a few days, but so far it seems to work fine. One thing to be aware of - the adapter came with the little slider switch in Write Protect mode. I could not write on the memory card from my laptop because of that, and almost embarrassed myself by asking Sandisk for support - the I realized what the problem was. I give 10% of the blame to Sandisk since the slider has no visual indication at all. A little dab of white ink would gave helped.

"Cameras are getting smaller and smaller at the same time their resolution is getting better and better.  In order to take full advantage of your pixels, your files get larger and larger ultimately rendering small sized picture cards less handy.  Most cameras now let you take a mini-movie which also eats up space quite quickly.This SanDisk card gives you the ability to store considerably more information in a neat small footprint.  If you do want to go with this card make sure it is compatible with your equipment.  Not every camera takes every card so you have to do some due diligence.",Positive,Positive
"A very cheap way of expanding memory on your 'phone. I have bought this because of the 8 mp camera on my 'phone, which means that memory gets used up quickly. This is also a good quality card. I usually find SanDisk products last at least a year before breaking, and even longer if you keep them in the device.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"I guess I should be happy it failed after only 1 month, because I only lost 1 month's worth of pictures etc.  I bought 3 of these cards for my wife, son and I.  My wife's had a minor glitch, which went away with a reboot.  Mine had a minor glitch this morning, so I expected the reboot to fix it.  No a reboot caused my Motorola Defy XT to tell me the card was blank and needed to be formatted.  My laptop won't even recognize the card when I put the card in it's reader.  After a couple hours of looking for a way to fix it, I have only found that this is very common for this specific card.EDIT: I was very happy with Sandisk after calling them.  They did say there are compatibility issues with CLASS 10 cards and some of the Android phones, and verified my phone is one of them.  They offered free replacement with a card that would be certain not to have the same issue mine just had, and also to attempt recovery of my items from the card.  These are the reasons we buy sandisk in the first place.  They did recommend a Class 4 or lower card to me for this phone.I am leaving this as a 1 star, because people should be aware of compatibility issues this severe.2nd Edit:  As of March 12, this replacement card, that wasn't going to ""be susceptible to the same type of failure"" is losing apps etc.  I am giving this card up.

"I purchased this Ultra MicroSDHC Class 10 card for my media player. I wanted to replace my 4GB cardwith this one so I could store more music. I like to have a wide range of music to pick from when I amon vacation or traveling on an airplane long distances. I think I may have bought too much.This card is advertised as water-proof, temperature proof, X-ray proof and shock proof. I will have totake their word for it. I am not going to test it.Just for fun I put the 16GB MicroSDHC disc (30MB/s Read Speed) into its provided adapter and used itin my cheapo cheapo Toshiba Camileo HD movie camera. Even at the Full High Definition resolution of1080p/30fps this disc performed very well. No stuttering, no missed frames and all this under low lightconditions. Nice. Very Nice. Those are big files at Full HD resolution. Read on...This card is 'USH-1' enabled which means it is the fastest card available (allegedly) and should reachup to a bus interface speed of 104 MB/s; if the electronic device you are using requires it. Of courseif your card reader or device does not support that speed you will be transferring data at your usualspeed. Sort of like saying it is backward compatible but don't expect blazing speeds. You can feeddata through only so fast.Transferring RAW photos and a Full HD digital film can take a lot of time to transfer. Those are hugefiles to transfer so the USH-I enabled disc is perfect for that purpose. They are working on USH-IIwhich is supposed to allow up to 300MB/s transfers.

Probably, but for the price it was a terrific deal to get a Class 10USH-1 enabled card and have the flexibility to use it in a variety of my electronic devices. Hmm. Onsecond thought I may just keep this card for the movie camera and get another ""slower"" one for mymedia player.As usual I have had no problems with this card.

"The card seemed to work well in most devices that I tried it in, but in a Samsung Galaxy S4 it would continue to unmount and mount over & over on the phone - a known issue on the Galaxy S4 forums due to a possibly bad batch of them.  I tried to reformat the card in the phone and from a PC computer, but that didn't help.  Finally I just called SanDisk and they had to RMA the card, which took about 2 weeks from start to finish when I had the new card in my hand.  The new 64 GB card from SanDisk looks slightly different, but still has gray & red on it.  However, it now works great in the Galaxy S4 and hasn't had any unmounting issues now for the past 3 weeks.Good card for pretty much everything else, except in the new Samsung Galaxy S4 phones.",Positive,Positive

"I bought 4 of these units (yes, at Amazon):  SanDisk Ultra 32 GB microSDHC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card 30MB/s with Adapter SDSDQUA-032G-U46A for 3 Samsung Galaxy SIII and one Samsung Note 2, and found that one in the SGIII has stopped working. I tried everything, in a computer, in different adapters - dead is dead. Since the other three are used by non-techno people, I am not sure if they are still working or not.When I contacted SanDisk, they gave me test instructions, which of course all failed the tests. To return, I have to pay for shipping that MUST BE tracked. This will cost around $20 for a $26 item. I ignored this, and shipped with a regular mail. I should not expect anything back, but who knows.For $6 more I have another unit, and I can tell you it will not be a SanDisk Ultra. Oh, well, the average price for the 3 remaining units will then be $34 (33% more than the purchase price).If I get a replacement, I will update this message.Update:I got an e-mail from SanDisk to advise me that they did receive the item and it is being processed. Shipping without tracking cost me $0.65 vs. $20. At least I have to give their customer service (or return department?) credit for being honest.

"There's not a lot one can say about a micro SD card. This one has this cool red stripe on it. It's Class 10, making it fast. It works. 'Nuff said.My application was for mounting in a Microsoft Surface RT tablet. I encrypted it with BitLocker to be safe. No problems.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"Start at four stars.Plus one star, because it's FINALLY a 128GB SD card.  I have been longing for this for quite some time.Minus one star because its performance is spotty.  I've been using one in a Surface Pro for a couple months now, and while the write speeds will peak at a sustained 15MB/sec, it often slows to 1 or 2, even in the middle of a large file copy.  I assume that's due to typical flash memory erase cycles or something, but I can't imagine it would be at all reliable for recording video to in your phone.In the end, I like it well enough to get two, but it's really only good for mass storage with low bandwidth requirements.",Positive,Positive
this card works fine with my huawei. my phone recognized it and loaded it with problems. i'm satisfied with this purchase.,Positive,Positive
"why worry about the packaging.  THis was the best I could find at the time for a name brand class 10 micro sdhc card.  Came with basic packaging and  a full SD card to adapt, which is what I needed.Works great, speed tests show excellent speed for video recording.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"With a USB 3.0 card reader, CrystalDiskMark shows blazing fast 47MB/s read but disappointingly slow 13MB/s write speed. So you can pretty much forget about reliable 1080P video recording.Update: It is correct that write speed great than 10MB/s is enough for 1080P recording. I need to clarify that the card is very slow when UHS-1 is not enabled. The read/write speeds drop to 13.3/7.9 MB/s. For devices that are a few years old such as Canon T2i which does not support UHS, 1080P recording may not be reliable. This card is classified as ""class 10,"" it should support sustained write speed of at least 10MB/s without UHS. It fails my test, as observed by other reviewers as well.",Negative,Negative
"Well since 16 GB is not enought for me I purchased this one specifically for my Samsung Galaxy Note 2 (Which by the way is far better than the iphone 5)... I have both so I can compare and I am not trolling... In any caseThe SanDisk 64gb works perfectly with the Note 2. I transferred the original info from my previous 16 gb sdcard to this in a heart beat. Now I have movies, music everything. Works Great.Dont understand how people can rate it with a 1... Product works as described 5/5",Strongly Positive,Positive
"Works great in my modern phone and tablet. However I was unable to use it on my PC's SD card reader. It appears the older card readers are not compatible with Class 10 as both my new cards could not be written to without the operating system (Win7) reporting write errors.I probably should blame the card reader, but it never failed me until trying to write to this card.",Positive,Positive
"Card runs great in my Note 2. Not sure how it compares to other ones in benchmark tests now, but there weren't that many options available to me at the time I bought it.Love having 64 Gig's of storage on my phone.",Positive,Positive
"Very satisfying purchase.Needed to increase  the storage capacity  of my Core i5 Samsung Series 7 Slate PC which was EM equipped lwith a 128GB SSD.  This 64GB memory card fit the bill perfectly. Did my research. Cconfirmed a Micro SDxc card and  64GB capacity can  work in the memory card slot of my Windows 7 Pro slate device.  Purchased  the memory card at a very attractive price. ( Amazon was offering a daily deal at the same time period I needed the product)  Memory card arrived without delay.  Packaging was very siimple (worry free...for real).  Plugged  SD card in my slate. PC card slot.  Formatted card to exFAT  vs  NTFS ( after more research ).and I was ready to go.  Transferred my photos and music from SSD  to the SD card.  Freed up valuable  SSD real estate for OS use and my Slate PC is again  humming  with lot more  SSD space available. Plays back  music, video & photo slideshows smoothly from the card. Delivers on function.  Very  satisfied with purchase ..and highly recommended 5 stars no hesitation !...",Strongly Positive,Positive
"I for one have not bought into Google's, or anybody else's, idea that streaming everything is so great.  With all the regressive data caps and sketchy throughput, I never want to rely on something being available to me online.  Much better to have it local.  And with this new card I can finally pack all of my music (~56GB), all of my photos, dozens of reference ebooks, and a few videos to boot and still I have around 9GB free as breathing room for my podcatcher.  The only real bummer with this card is the speed.  Just as I got acclimated to SanDisk's 64GB Extreme Plus level of speed, going back to ordinary class 10 speed that this card has is a little painful.  Luckily playing music or even playing videos doesn't oversaturate the read performance.  What WILL trip you up however is doing a straightforward copy or move operation while you're listening to something.  This card does not seem to handle multiple simultaneous operations without something going awry.  So long as you understand it's limitations and you can live with them, the enormous amount of storage you can pack into your phone or tablet is very welcome.So far I've used one of these in a Samsung Galaxy Note 2 N7100, LG G Pad, and a Sony Xperia Z1 Compact - all with success.",Positive,Positive
"What more can be said?  It's a great card with plenty of storage space to handle or expand your tablet, camera or video cameras needs.  With the included SD card adapter, the micro card can be read in any SD card reader/writer.  It is initially formatted in some format that my Windows 8 Pro MS Surface Pro could read or see.  But from another laptop using the SD adapter I was able to reformat it and make it usable for the Surface Pro.Great card for a great price!",Strongly Positive,Positive
"Does the job. This item is available almost anywhere, but Amazon had it for the lowest price. My girlfriend needed an upgrade for her smartphone and this memory card works quite well. She has tested it by shooting some sample videos and they came out very clear. She said there is plenty of room for apps, games, photos, and of course, videos. I highly recommend this all who need it.",Strongly Positive,Positive
I knew buying sandisk i would get a great sd card and its super fast. I really like it in my phone.If you need a micro sd card this one will perform great and not let you down.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"I use this in my Samsung Galaxy SIII and it has been great. There have been a few instances when the card was not recognized, but simply rebooting the phone fixed the problem. I am unsure whether this is a Samsung issue (probably), or a SanDisk issue, but it has only happened 2 to 3 times over the course of a year and a half. Overall, the write speeds are fast enough that you can record 1080p video directly to the card, which is exactly what I wanted it for. It does come with a full-size SD card enclosure, allowing you to use this in devices that require that type of memory card. Recommended!",Positive,Positive
"I have been using the same old 4gb card since I had a Motorola SLVR. I figured it was time to upgrade, I'm glad I did. The speed of the class 10 is a major difference in my smartphone. From taking pictures faster with less lag in between shots to shuffling through my music without a delay. Highly recommend to anyone looking to upgrade. With that being said, beware of fakes! I originally purchased one off of ebay, not paying attention to its location. It came shipped directly from china. It was DOA! Luckily I managed to get refunded through paypal. Didn't have that issue through Amazon though!",Strongly Positive,Positive
"If this was any more worthless, it would have a retched stench.  This card has completely turned me away from ever trusting another SanDisk product again.  I would only use this in the future to keep corrupt mis-information to frustrate anyone attempting to acquire any of my data.I have reformatted it 3-4 times IN FULL using various allocation sizes and operating systems.  It only functions under Windows, it randomly works in my mobile devices.  Now i'm left to decide if I want to bother researching this to better understand the problem in the future, or simply purchase another card from a more reliable manufacturer...... hello Kingston.",Strongly Negative,Negative
"I've got a number of SanDisk brand products.  None has ever failed me over the 10+ years I've used them.  That's saying something these days in electronics.This card is performing well, and keeping up with the data storage devices I am using it for (one video recorder, one scanner).  Somehow, I would expect nothing less, but then again it is good to know that quality is consistent.",Strongly Positive,Positive
Works very well with my new Tab Pro 8.4&#34;.  Have been able to download lots of content from YouTube to watch on long flights. Will use it on any device that takes sd cards.  Very happy with it.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"I got this to expand the memory storage in my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1. The tablet and paperwork claim to support up to 32GB, but other reviews for these cards and the Note 10.1 said that a 64GB worked just fine. And work just fine it does.I store mostly music on here, as I've got over 22GB worth of music, which would have taken up most of the 32GB built in to the tablet. I also use my tablet for sheet music, so I needed to have the capability to have all that on there, too. So this was my best solution, and so far it's worked wonderfully.And, on top of that, it came with a MicroSD card to SD card adapter, making file transfers even easier. Overall, I would highly, highly recommend this product!",Strongly Positive,Positive
"I bought this for use in the GoPro Hero3 Black Edition.  It has excellent storage and R/W speeds.  I have filmed at 1080p w/ 60fps and shot pictures at a rate of 30 pictures/ 1 second and there were no issues at all.Excellent product, especially for this camera.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"I've seen several recent reviews complaining about not getting any packaging with their SD cards.  One person even questioned if the card was new or not.  Amazon offers &#34;frustration-free&#34; packaging for many of their products where they take care of opening it for you, then they repack it in plain brown cardboard to make it easier on the consumer.  This card has the option to come in the retail packing, or in amazon's &#34;frustration-free&#34; packaging.  It's an ordering option, and it seems this option defaults on &#34;frustration-free&#34;.If you order the retail packaging option, it will look just like it does on the store shelves.",Neutral,Neutral
Works just fine. Haven't had any issues. Bought another 32gb micro sd mini but haven't used it yet. So far I'm pleased with the purchase.Ordered the hassle free packaging and the card seems legit. Decided to order the retail packaging for the other card since I read stories about fakes being shipped to people.,Positive,Positive
"Speed is great.  Works great.  Works great in everything I have tried... and to be honest, My wife thinks I am creating  the &#34;Disneyworld&#34; of electronics with all the goodies I have bought.  Well, they are my toys (for a very old juvenile) and this memory makes them a lot better.",Strongly Positive,Positive
i give this memory card a 5 star because it works like a charm easy to use plug and play. The packaging is easy to open so you don't have to worry about damaging the card itself . Slipped it right in my Samsung galaxy S-3 maxing out the card slot with this SanDisk 64gb but it only displays (59.47gb) its stable and fast works really good. didn't have to format anything or do any extra steps to use it. i recommend this to everyone,Strongly Positive,Positive

"I use this in tandem with a NiftyDrive on my MacBook Pro. For those of you who don't know, the Nifty Drive is a small adapter made from machined aluminum that fits seamlessly into your Mac's SSD slot. With a 128 GB Micro SSD you can add hard drive space very inexpensively. I put my entire DropBox folder (over 100 gbs) on this thing, and it is every bit as fast as the Mac's internal SSD. In fact, I think it might be faster.",Strongly Positive,Positive

"Bought this to expand my HTC Sensation.  Still haven't loaded completely, and still not sure how well the sensation will organize 64gb of music.

I would recommend this memory to any smartphone user.",Strongly Positive,Positive

"This went into my new Samsung Galaxy Light cell phone to store my music files and my cell phone photos. Zero problems. These SD cards just work (until the don't). SanDisk is a top brand and I have no trouble recommending this. Look through the many dozens of other recommendations, too. Class 10 UHS-1 is one of the fastest protocols available currently.",Positive,Positive
"I got a card and it wouldn't let me copy files to it, it would (a) not recognize on any of the three computers or my android tab at home, and (b) unmount itself in the middle of file copies.  These two things happened randomly.  I got a replacement, but it suffered from the problem of letting me format it (yay, farther than I got with unit 1), then crapping out 300mb into a file transfer.AVOID THIS GUY.",Strongly Negative,Negative
"Happily nestled in the memory slot of my Nook Tablet and performing as promised.  Now, if only the Nook memory slot were easier to access....  All well.  The card arrived on time, well packaged, and has been chugging right along for two months now.  I would definately recommend it to any lover of video, music, or other space consuming files.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"Works great in my Galaxy S III.  I converted all my ""good"" music to .flac files so I have lossless playback using the Android GoneMAD player and couldn't be happier.  Transfer speed it good and there are no hickup when playing back these 45M+ audio files.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"My ipod finally bit the dust, so I bought this card to use in my Galaxy 4 so I could use it as my new music player. It was very easy to transfer the music and get it playing right away. I can't complain at all, it was nice to be able to expand my storage on my phone enough with this that I didn't have to go buy another ipod. I have A LOT of music and this thing holds it all and doesn't slow my phone down at all. No complaints here, I actually bought another one of these for my Galaxy Tab so I can keep all my music on that too. So it's safe to say I would buy it again.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"I bought this as an expanded/backup memory for my tablet (a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3), and it installs easily, works quickly, and even has a great SanDisk memory app that helps me organize my files and see a visual representation of how much memory is taken and how much is free.It came with an adapter so I can plug it into my computer to transfer files if I want to, which is awesome.  Nothing bad to say about this memory card!",Strongly Positive,Positive
I'm not sure what I can say about this that will be helpful. We bought this 6 months ago. It worked when we bought it. It's still working. I can't say anything about speed since we haven't tested it. We've never had any issues with speed though. I trust SanDisk. Everything we've bought from them has been good.,Positive,Positive
Excellent. Got 2 of these but still testing to see if speed is its greatest deal. Anyway Cheap at the time.,Positive,Positive
"It is almost unbelievable that these micro SD cards can range in sizes up to 64Gb !  and at a class 10 to boot. Pun intended.Comes with the SD adapter, so it will work in any device that uses and SD or Micro SD memory card, just be sure to check whether or not your device can handle the extra memory. Some devices with recognize only 8 Gb or 16 Gb, which means that unless you check with the manufacturer, it is your fault you bought the wrong size memory, and you will not be able to exchange due to YOUR MISTAKE.This card used to cost upwards of $120 not that long ago, and now they are ridiculously cheap, especially for the quality and capacity you are getting.Thanks",Positive,Positive
Fast and reliable. Have worked with it for around 2 months now and nothing to complain about.Good fit for my Asus TF700,Strongly Positive,Positive
"With prices of tech items always dropping, getting the bleeding edge stuff usually costs a bit more. Thanks to Amazon and the ability to find deals like this, it was worth while getting the 64GB micro SDXC for my phone. I removed the 32GB I had in there for my Phantom 2 vIsion that had shipped with only a 4 GB unit.  Class 10 is where you want to be when using this for any video recording and you can always count on SanDisk for quality!",Positive,Positive
If your not sure what card to use in your GoPro this one works fantastic. The majority of stuff Ive seen researching it points to these. With the exception of some issues with the 64GB. But I cant validate that and Im not sure its still a problem. Ive been using these for about 3 years now with no problems.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"I was out of space on my Droid RAZR 16GB and still had an empty microSD slot, so I figured I'd pick this up seeing as how it is a reputable brand in flash memory. I am glad I went with the Sandisk Ultra, because there is seemingly no difference in speed between this drive and the built-in internal memory of my phone. I record a lot of videos with my phone and I've been recording straight to this card in HD with no problems at all.Installation was a breeze. I took the memory card out of the package and inserted into my phone. Then my phone brought up a menu asking if I wanted to move my music, videos, and photos to the memory card. I selected all three categories, and in minutes it had moved all of my media onto the memory card. I didn't even have to do anything else. I had read some other reviews that said they had to reformat the card or mess around with moving files by hand, but I didn't have to do any of that.I haven't tried using the included SD adapter yet, but I imagine it will work as well as any other adapter. The adapter and memory card were both shipped in a little clear plastic case, which makes it easier to carry the adapter around with you. So you have it with you when you need it.The price on this card when I bought it was a few dollars more than the generic brands. I decided to spend a few extra dollars on it since I would be really upset if I lost all my photos and videos due to a corrupt memory card. I am very satisfied with the product and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to increase the storage capacity of their phone or anything else this would fit in.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"Functions perfectly in my Samsung Galaxy Tab II.  No issues with slow processing times.  Great product, I highly recommend this memory card for tablets.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"Ok so my Dad needed a MicroSD for his GS3 (Galaxy S 3) because he was using way to much space with videos and pictures; he isn't one of the most tech saavy people in the world so I got this for him. Does it work yes it does and very well I might add. Like I said my Dad doesn't work to well with tech and if a MicroSD slowed his phone down when it saved pictures or videos or ran apps from it he wouldn't be happy and wouldn't know what to do with the problem. This card experiences no lag (3 months in) the UHS-I speed class really lives up to its potential here. Best of all, perhaps a little known fact to most of you, this card is waterproof, so you get your phone wet and it dies, don't worry this card is still perfectly fine just pop it in a new phone and there's all your stuff! No cons as of yet will update as needed.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"I love this Micro SD because I used it as my main memory phone mostly because the Galaxy S4 it comes with a 9GB of free space. So I can pretty much just enjoy this Ultra 64GB for Music, Photos and Movies but not for Apps because my phone is not compatible with moving apps to the SD it stills works for other phones but not this one. I have to say this is one of the fastest Micro SD I ever bought recommended a lot.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"Plenty of room for all my photos, music and random documents I decide to load onto my phone. It works great with my HTC One M8 and apps stored on the SD card run as smooth as they did on the phone itself. File writes were as fast as I expected from an XC I card.The only downside, and this is minor, is the MicroSD adapter it comes with seems a little cheap. But hey, that's not the reason I bought this card.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"I purchased 2 of these, 1 for my HTC Incredible phone and the other for use in a key chain storage device. Both of these cards run very very hot.  After copying over 4GB of files, it was almost scalding to the touch.  But both have been reliable with only a few issues of reading them, both times in the thumb drive adapter, so that may have been at fault and not the card itself.",Positive,Positive
"Could not figure out why this card crashed multiple times in my Samsung Galaxy SIII, and demanded a reformatting. Then after 5hrs of calls to Sprint & Samsung I got a guy who reads factory stuff!Samsung Galaxy SIII is a Class 4 & Class 6 supported Motherboard, with Qualcomm processor. The Sprint stores only sell Class 4 memory, and there is a reason that Camera memory~Class 10 is not sold there, the board, just like in a PC, has to support the data stream. It does not!If you have an Android Phone you better make sure the motherboard supports it! Even Samsung's USA website does not tell you the board supported memory! They won't, and don't tell who the board manufacturer is in this Galaxy SIII phone. I asked at the Texas Samsung advanced tech support center after 1hr on hold, and they had no specs to even share. They don't get it!PASS IF YOU HAVE A CELL PHONE, UNLESS YOU GET IT IN WRITING FROM THE MOTHERBOARD MANUFACTURER OF YOUR PHONE. I went through this same stuff building custom PC's with Intel motherboards. Memory has to be built to run on this board, at this speed, with this processor, or it will not work properly, and will crash, and lose data.",Strongly Negative,Negative

We've never had a bunk card or any problems whatsoever over about 40 cards so far. I was advised by my gopro rep to be sure to buy from a name brand &#34;like sandisk&#34;. The adapter is well appreciated by the customer, not only because most people don;t have a port for the micro format, but also because microsd is so ridiculously small that its far too easy to lose.Have and will buy again.",Strongly Positive,Positive

"They're nice cards. They're fast, come from a reputable brand, hold 32GB in a card the size of a fingernail, and really don't cost that much anymore. There are several brands of cards you can choose from, but I always liked SanDisk. I haven't had issues with their products.Also, the red and gray branding on the card makes it a bit easier to spot the card in case you drop it or leave it somewhere.",Strongly Positive,Positive

"I don't want to write a review for each of the 8, 16, 32, and 64 GB SanDisk MicroSDHC Class 10 Cards. They're all 5 stars. They're extremely fast, and as Class 10s, have allowed my Canon SX50's shutter to speed up because it transfers information so quickly with the camera's very small processor. They also allow a burst mode of 9-13 fps which is amazing for a non-DSLR.These cards are also very reliable. I've had no read/write failures in the two years that I've been using them.The one &#34;negative&#34; is that they're so small and can be dropped easily when getting them out of the adapter. Still, if you've been working with computers since there was a gerbil running the power for your PC, you have to marvel at how anything this small can hold more than 30,000 high def 6 GB photos on a 64 GB card that is smaller than your pinky nail.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"Not much to say about this other than it works fine.  The included adapter was difficult to remove the microSDHC card from, but that may be due to my big fingers (plus the card is very small as one would expect from micro naming).  The speed is more than adequate with no buffering issues noticed from video capture on a phone at HD(720) resolution.  Recommended.",Positive,Positive
"I bought this to stash all (the ones I would watch on the go) the movies and songs that I previously owned to my new Galaxy S4. I am extremely impressed with how fast the device works outside of the phone and inside when used by the phone. It is dramatically slow when the phone with the sd card in it is wired up to the computer via usb, but that is really unrelated and the process isnt painstaking. Fast and huge in capacity, definitely a must for enthusiasts.NOTE: As of ICS, Android has stopped allowing the movement of apps into the sd card. So if youre planning on installing games onto the card, you will need to have a rooted phone. The card is very useful for other things (music and video, and ROMS if youre interested) even then.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"Wow! Fast memory card. I bought this for my new GoPro Hero 3. Great performance for full HD video.Shipping was fast, and nice communication on shipping and estimated arrival time.The SD Card adaptor works perfect in my full sized SD reader built in my laptop.Transfer speeds were blazing and read speeds are amazing.SanDisk is the best, really worth buy the top end class 10 micro SD card.If you doing HD video this is the card for you. Video is demanding, so youneed a SD Card that can keep up.In Hawaii we play hard, and the GoPro and SanDisk card have been working flawless at full 1080p60 video.",Strongly Positive,Positive
Don't even waste your time buying this memory card. 64GB is written on it but its actually even less than 3GB that's in it.i have never experienced such deception.i had tried loading my pics and music and other data on it from day one but no matter what i did i won't take more than 3GB of data. i didn't realise till i read other stories of similar memory cards that will state 64GB but would contain a smaller memory capacity often times even less than 10GB.i bought this card for $49.what a big waste!!now i am so scared of buying memory cards on amazon or online elsewhere.i wouldn't dear it again!it was in a sealed  sanddisk packet so i was thinking it must be original.Alas!it was a big  waste!i have lost confidence in buying memory card on amazon.,Strongly Negative,Negative
"I purchased this micro memory card for my GPS. When I updated the maps recently, the GPS ran out of room and I could no longer put the entire US map in it.

"Got this yesterday, the 64GB item. Installed it in my new Samsung Tab3 and turned it on. the Tab3 saw it right away, and I decided to format it,,, only took a couple of seconds and I was good to go. It shows that I have 59,000 memory units available, they must use the rest for overhead I guess. I haven't used it yet, but I am sure it will work fine. If I have any problems I will note here,,, also if I have great praise for it I will note that also. At $34.99 I guess it was a good price as I see it is now $46.00, maybe I shoulda ordered two of them. This is my first time for a lap top, and I will be on a big learning curve. I got the lap top at Costco last week,,,,,,,, I sure hope a old dog can learn new tricks.....",Positive,Positive
Got a Transformer Infinity Tablet (32 GB) which was a decent amount to begin with; However I wanted a microSD to double it to have a decent storage size. I decided to go with SanDisk since I've never gotten any bad portable storage from them before.MicroSD is still working fine in my tablet. Has my videos I wanna watch on the go when I have my tablet. Also useful to store and apps to for installation.,Strongly Positive,Positive

What can I say - its a memory card. It remembers what its supposed to. At least it remembers as well or better than I do.Only problem I have with these Micro SD cards is - they're so small they're easy to lose. If these things get any smaller we will start inhaling them by accident when we sneeze or something.,Positive,Positive
"Still going strong after a few months on my HTC phone. Did get disconnected a few times though, not sure if its due to the card or the phone. Hopefully it can last :)",Strongly Positive,Positive
"It works fine in my phone.  The phone detected errors when first used and I was worried, but I let the phone reformat it and all is good.  Excellent for the price.Beware it may not work in older devices.",Positive,Positive
This is just great. but the damned thing is really small. I had one before but I put it down and lost it for good.,Strongly Positive,Positive
Works great in my Note II. No issues. Reads and writes fast. No corrupted files and my Note II had no issues reading this card. My friend bought an off brand card because it was cheaper and every so often he gets a &#34;card not found&#34; error. Good buy.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"I bought the 32gb version here for my Samsung Proclaim android phone (Straight Talk Wireless model). Removed my current 4gb card from the phone, put it in one card reader in my Mac, then put the new 32gb card in another card reader in my Mac, copied all phone files over to the new card (saving the old 4gb as a backup for now). (Note: I did not have to do any formatting of the new card to read it on the Mac or in the phone.) Inserted 32gb in my phone, booted it up and have had no problems in first hour of use. Will update if I notice overheating, card failure, etc. as reported by a few others here. I'm showing about 29.3 gb of available storage on the card as received from Amazon (before copying my files to it).",Strongly Positive,Positive
"I bought this for use in my new GoPro Hero3 black and it works great. I like the fact that it comes with an adapter, though I really wish that we'd move to USB adapters as the standard ""accessory"". Highly recommend.",Strongly Positive,Positive
i have this in  my go pro hero 3 black.  works good hold a ton of videos and pics.  fair price after shopping around thanks prime!  this is the maximum the go pro can take so have at it!,Strongly Positive,Positive
"Works Great with my Note 2.  Had no problems installing it and I didn't have to format or anything.  I put it in, turned the phone back on and everything transferred over quickly.Thanks!",Strongly Positive,Positive
"I use these for cell phone and other devices requiring a MicroSD Card.  This one is compatible with all my devices, even the ones that are &#34;outmoded&#34; like my cell phone.  Works great.  No problems storing or reading data, ever.  I consistently use SanDisk for my cameras, music devices, etc. Highly recommended.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"The number 1 thing that's important about a product is that it works and works well, and this card does.Before purchasing, make sure your phone or camera supports this card. I'm currently using this with the Galaxy S3 and it's been working flawlessly. So far I have only used 16gigs of the sd card and the S3 phone loads everything in a couple of seconds every time I have restarted the phone.Just because the card is class 10 does not mean it will make your device faster. The device being used has to be capable of supporting the card for them to work together harmoniously.Also, some devices (like the Galaxy S3) do not require the card to be formatted and it can be used straight out of the box. With a 59 gig capacity (as the rest is reserved for the card software) I do not have to worry about running out of space anytime soon as I was with my previous 8 gig card.",Strongly Positive,Positive
Transfer files easily and very fast. Sandisk makes great SD card and they are very reliable. I am very pleased with this product.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"Fast access time AMAZING amount of storage in such a small size.And the price was impressive,could not beat it!Thanks Amazon!",Strongly Positive,Positive
I've been using this card on my Venue Pro 8 without any issues.  I used primarily to store photos and videos. The card is reliable but not fast.  Data transfers on Windows range from 15 to 20MB/s.  That speed is sufficient for most purposes.  I got my card at $32 which is s good deal.  A faster card can easily double this price.,Positive,Positive
"awesome! Worked well with the Surface 2 tablet.I later return the Surface 2 tablet , since it didn't seem like that I needed it but I made sure to take out the memory card :)Never had any issues with it though when I had it.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"The item arrive in time, but was unfortunately defective as it would not accept a copy operation. Further investigation led to discovering the card had bad sectors. Refund is progressing without a hitch however, so not all was lost.",Negative,Negative
Can't go wrong with Sandisk! Always works. Never any issues. And this one is no different. More than enough storage space,Strongly Positive,Positive
"As described, no problems. Recommend it.Only problem, price is too high. ...I may order the 64 GB as well.",Positive,Positive
"It's a 128GB microSD card, so there isn't much to say about it.  Make sure you check that the device you'd like to use this with can handle this much space.  It comes with an SD adapter, so if you have an SD port on your computer you can use it there.  Happily have this plugged into my Galaxy S5.Pros:- Lots of space- Durable little buggerCons:- Price per GB ratio is bad (but considering the tech this is probably as good as it'll get for a while)",Positive,Positive
never had any problems with memory from san disk.  quality good products.  buy again for future needs.  good for a long time,Strongly Positive,Positive
I use it in my Samsung Galaxy 3 cell phone and it works great.  Good value and quality. I highly recommend it.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"I wanted to believe that those people who wrote bad reviews on memory cards were just unlucky. Well it sucks being one of them. I cannot get this card to format not matter what device, software or technique I use. The mistake I made was that I didn't use the card right away to see if it was good -I thought, its a memory card, what could go wrong. Now I'm out of the US and returning it is not economically sensible. I don't know if it's quality control, but this card simply cannot work in any reader, device, with or without adapter (write protection off on the reader of course). The card shows up on devices, may even show data being copied then when you refresh, nothing has happened. All formatting software says it's write protected and nothing I do can remove it. Why would a new card come write protected anyway?  Very disappointing, especially since I lost data from my phone.",Strongly Negative,Negative
"I use SanDisk Ultra SDHC cards for photo and video and have always been satisfied. When it came to needing a MicroSDHC for a GoPro, I purchased this card. It provides the same reliability, consistency and workflow as the larger SDHC cards and with the included adapter, it easily installs in my current SDHC card reader. It also means I can use it as a back up for my SDHC cards, should the need arise, giving an extra 32 GB as a spare card. Good card at a good price.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"This is one of the better reviewed SDHC Class 10 cards that utilized UHS. By reading the reviews you will see that it reads/writes at a better speed than many or most cards out there right now. Much depends on your phone, how your phone's OS stores information on a card and what's inside your device. For MOST of us; you probably will not notice anything different between this card and any other GOOD quality card out there. I usually pick the fastest cards on the market when the prices drop. The main problem, speed related is when you transfer large amounts of data (usually music) onto any card. If you use a standard USB 2 connection this card won't speed that process up. If you use a USB 3 or if you actually put this card into a USB 3 reader to do the transfer; then you'll see a nice boost. If your device requires a card that the product can UTILIZE and has the OS and chipset to take advantage of this FAST card; it's a no brainer. If your device is older, if you just like storing music; then you can find a cheaper good quality card. If you find this at a good price no matter what you have... BUY IT",Positive,Positive
After a long research about the SD cards. I came across this deal. I wanted an SD card for my new Samsung Note 3. None of the review was talking about Note 3. Most of the reviews were either about note 2 or S4.A few reviews were talking about possible problem of not able to recognize the card and getting into the cycle where you have to call SanDisk. I was not sure to go for it or not. Although choices were very thin. Samsung cards were way out of my budget.So I decided to take a chance and I am happy that I did.It's working smoothly. No need to format. Just works great. One star for not exactly 64 GB. It shows up 59GB.I will again update this post after 1 month. When I will really sure it has no problem,Positive,Positive
I am really pleased with all SamDisk flash drives I've had and this is no different.  It went in my sons mobile and nothing but good things to say...like it should be,Strongly Positive,Positive
"I am primarily using this to supplement storage on my Microsoft Surface Pro and have a small library of movies and TV shows to carry around while I'm on the go. A lot of ultrabooks and the like come with just 128gb of storage and I think this SD card is a great way to store some media while you save room on the hard-drive for your program installations etc. The speeds I'm seeing are consistently around the peak that the card is rated for, and work great for playback of my lossless MKV movie files recorded at a high blu-ray quality bitrate. I've also tried it with my Android smartphone and I'm seeing similarly high peak-performance speeds for file transfer and smooth playback of media. It comes with an adapter to convert it to the standard SD card size in use with devices like SLR cameras etc. so you'll be covered under almost any circumstance. I only wish I could buy a larger capacity model, but as it stands I think with the Amazon sale prices that regularly come for this product it's a great deal.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"This was a great little memory card for using with my Microsoft Surface Pro tablet.  I'm able to have my music with me at all times, plus a large number of photos.One item to note: this type of memory card may not be suitable for high speed applications (such as with a camera or for storing virtual hard drive type information).  These micro cards are a 5 star if used for their intended purpose.",Strongly Positive,Positive
Works well no problems with SanDisk products. Always a good risk to use this brand of card. Price was right and shipping was fast.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"I bought this card and it worked OK, at first. After about three weeks I noticed that some images were not showing up, a week later it began to loose everything. My Note 2 was failing to recognize it, inserted into the adapter and my comp could see it but not read all the files. Multiple formats by either the comp or Note 2 did not fix the problem, even tried some tools that I used for my DSLR, still no-go.This could just be a batch problem as the card looks legit and was fast in the beginning.",Strongly Negative,Negative
"Installed as sublimental memory for Samsung Tab 3 8 inch tablet.  Doesn't look like apps can be installed on the card, but that is a Tab 3 issue, not a San Disk issue.  Something to think about when chosing your tablet.  I plan on installing a lot of memory hogging field guide apps, so theTab 3's 16 GB built in memory may be a problem for me.  On the other hand, I have a lot of music, so the SD card will be useful.",Neutral,Neutral
"It came on time, with the adapter. I installed it on my Samsung Galaxy 5. Works great!Scanning 32 GB takes a little more time than the 8 GB I had before - it is expected - nothing to 'complain' about.I would recommend it to anyone interested.",Positive,Positive
"Bought this to use in a ContourROAM video camera. It was the Deal of the Day, meaning a special discounted price. Also came with hassle-free packaging. Never a worry with SanDisk memory. Awesome deal.",Strongly Positive,Positive
I got a note 2 and needed more memory  well this is the one to get. I have had no problems with it. Recommended,Strongly Positive,Positive
"Very confident with this brand, never failed me ever since.  Placed it to my E72, performed great.  Looking forward to long years of using this chip.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"I didn't  even have this card installed in my Motorola  Razor HD for 6 months when I turned my phone on yesterday and got a message stating I removed my card before properly unmounting it first even though it was still installed. I plugged it into my PC adapter and nothing! I lost about 300 documents and over 500 pictures, but i'm glad that I just backed up everything 2 weeks ago. Worked great until it died far to soon and without any warning at all. Be sure to backup all your important data frequently!",Strongly Negative,Negative
"The first one had some sort of problem, and would stop responding to the phone or stop playing music, a reboot often fixed it for a period of time, but inevitably it would stop again.  Amazon replaced the unit quickly and the replacement works perfectly (I am so glad it wasn't my phone!).  I have almost 10,000 songs on my phone now, who needs a separate music player.  It would easily handle video, photos or a monster app collection as well, it's great taking a modest capacity phone and making it bigger than anyone else offers stock, for far less than you can buy the phone with the extra capacity.",Positive,Positive
"Love this card, its fast and sports an insane 128gb of storage. Amazon had a killer price on it too, well below the big box stores. Works perfect with my phone and my HD video recorder.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"Seems like a good alternative to flash drive. Cost per gig seems like a pretty good deal, very convenient to carry around. I put my reading, music, pictures and videos on separate cards. Much more portable. Unfortunately smart phones and tablets are lagging.",Positive,Positive
"I bought these microSDXC cards for use in my tablet, however, my tablet only recognizes FAT32 formatted cards and not the exFAT that these cards use. I had suspicions about this based upon other reviewers' experiences. Windows computers will not reformat in FAT32 beyond the 32 GB limit. I was able to locate a small program that would reformat a drive to FAT32 without the 32GB limitation (FAT32 can accommodate up to a 3 TB drive). I used the Windows GUI version of fat32format (freeware) and it quickly reformatted the memory card. Now the card works in my tablet.",Positive,Positive
"Ordered it on 1/10/13, never received the first 2 sup[posed shipments then 32 days later an envelope arrives with a counterfeit SD card that was detected as fake with H2TESTW software after writing only 71mb's it crashed several times. No hologram or individual serial number on the Chinese knock off packaging either. Make sure you know where they are coming from! Only buy these from reputable authorized dealers! It's worth the extra couple bucks to avoid this frustration!",Strongly Negative,Negative
"I purchased this to increase the memory of my Samsung Galaxy 10.1 tablet.  Just placed it into the slot, was instantly recognized and thus saving my internal memory and increasing the memory of my device. Price was the best, I went to several sites and price closest was $98.  Shipped through my prime and got it in 2 days.  I have seen no issues with this card and am very happy with the purchase.",Strongly Positive,Positive
Purchased two of these in total. One to hold the music for my mp3 player and one to hold the music for my smart phone. Both work well. Easy to load. No problems encountered. They serve my intended purposes well. Arrived quickly and in good condition. Pleased with purchase.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"I purchased this memory card to use to expand the memory of my new Surface RT tablet. This memory card appealed to me first because I have always liked SanDisk products. Second, the price you this particular 64 GB card is a steal. The memory card includes both an adapter for the PC and a clear plastic case. Though I've only been using this card for a few weeks, I purchased a similar card earlier this year to use in my smartphone, and so far so good. I highly recommend this item if you need to expand the storage on your tablet.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"I bought this to add more storage to a Sharper Image action (Go Pro knock-off) camera, and it fits the bill perfectly. The camera came with a generic 4gb card, but this 32gb Class 10 card provides much smoother playback. A nice deal for just under $17.",Strongly Positive,Positive
This ultra micro-sd card is faster than the standard micro-sd cards. However the adapter provided with the card is not good. Data Transfer was quicker when used with a different adapter than the one provided with the micro-sd card,Positive,Positive
