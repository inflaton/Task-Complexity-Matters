Bought from BestBuy online the day it was announced. I have tested in my Sony Xperia Z Ultra and my 12inch Samsung Pro tablet.Both work fine. Shows 119GB available. Only issue I have is that I paid 199.99 for it :(Best Buy will most likely match this though.,Positive,Positive
I love this card and it is super fast. Great for putting it in a tablet to keep it from slowing up. And it was $15 reg $70 gives me something to brag about too.,Strongly Positive,Positive
Has a fast response time.Your going to need to buy one of these eventually since smart phones are advancing and so are the tablets coming out.Slided it write into my phone and worked like a charm on the first try.Pictures and apps load really fast with no lag time.Love it so much im going for the 64gb and always class 10 for me.1 less thing to worry about.,Strongly Positive,Positive
I've used one of those cards in my phone for about 2 years now and never had a single problem. Recently bought another for my tablet and so far so good. Recommended,Strongly Positive,Positive
"Great value. Fast shipping. Brand you can trust.My previous card by &#34;another manufacturer&#34; died after only 3 months of use, along with everything on it.For 64 GB, this card is a beast of a value. I've dropped my phone hard several times and had no data lost from this card. It's fantastic.My primary use is recording 1080p video and high rez pictures to the device, as well as audio recordings. I use this for media.  It's fast transfer speed allows it to keep up with all my demands. Only time will tell how truly reliable/durable it turns out to be. I'm going on 2 months now as of January 2014. Any adversities I have along the way, I will post here in updates.Smashing good value of a card!TIP: When you first get your card, be sure to use your phone (or other device you'll be using it in) to format it. This is standard practice with all card based memory, and will prevent you from encountering errors or oddities with your device.",Positive,Positive
This is the third card I've ordered and I will buy a fourth when needed. The frustration free packaging is amazing! It's an envelope that has a pull-tab. Can't get any simpler than that! The card itself is a class 10+ and I have not had any issues with any of the ones I've bought. This one went to my brother to upgrade the storage on his phone.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"I got this for my Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7 (p6800) and it worked great for about 3 weeks - September 18 through today, October 7.  It just died while I had the tablet attached to my PC and was copying another file onto it, so I've changed my rating from 5 stars to just 1 star.  I'd give 0 stars if I could.  Another user warned me that this had happened to him after 4 1/2 months, but 3 weeks?!?!?!?!?  I've reported this to Amazon and asked for a refund.Stay as far away from this card as you can, at least for the Galaxy Tab 7.7.UPDATE:  Amazon refunded my money for this card, and I replaced it with the Samsung equivalent, which is STILL working perfectly.  Don't waste your time and money on this card - get the Samsung.",Strongly Negative,Negative
"I've used the 32GB version of this card since I got it in two Android phones and no problems with either phone.  It gives me all the music, pictures, downloads, etc. storage I'll ever need.  As fast as any other card and faster than most.  I also love Amazon frustration fee packaging.  Since there are so many fakes with online retailers, buy from a trusted source like Amazon.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"Excellent brand, as good as any of the other cards I've ever used. Highly recommended for any appropriate uses. I like all of the San Disk products.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"This is one of those basic items that usually just work. In my case, I received one that just did not work. A couple of weeks ago, my phone reported an error and so I reformatted the card and transferred my music back onto it. Unfortunately it failed again two days ago and it won't even format now. I have had good luck with SanDisk before, but this one was not a good experience.",Strongly Negative,Negative
"Pros: 32 GBs more for my tablet. Works great.Cons: None to speak ofOverall: I hold this and I feel like I'm going to lose it. It is the perfect size to add storage to my tablet, though, and that is what I want it for.",Strongly Positive,Positive
I bought it to expand the memory on a cheap Android tablet. It is recognized and works fine. No problems.,Positive,Positive
"I just don't get what has happened to SanDisk quality.  It seems to have gone down over the years.  This product was glitchy from day one.  I thought it would be fine after a quick check disk, but then it only got worse.  After less than a week I have to return it.  What upsets me is that this is not my first bad experience with SanDisk products.  I used to buy them all the time, they were my brand of choice for flash memory (cards or thumb drives).  The last three products I have bought from them have had problems and failed either immediately or shortly after usage.  So I give up.  I will start looking to other companies for my memory needs.  I bought a Transcend to replace this.  I hope it works out better.",Strongly Negative,Negative
"This went into my Raspberry Pi, and it works great. I have had nothing but success from this little guy. Also, it conveniently came with the SD adapter.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"Broke after  2 weeks.....I will go back to Samsung HD cards... This was a waste of time and money. Actually, I should ask for a refund",Strongly Negative,Negative
"While updating maps for my Nuvi 40 I received a message stating I needed more memory to download new versions of maps that I required.This was probably a bit of overkill, but the price was right, so I ordered one. Two days later, I installed it and it worked flawlessly with mucho memory left for future needs. Will be buying a few more of them for other uses, can't go wrong with this card!!!See ya'",Strongly Positive,Positive
Great transfer speeds for my Tablet. Going on a month now and it works just fine. Highly recommend it to anyne.,Strongly Positive,Positive
I have both the Samsung Skyrocket and Note 2 Android phones and this card works great.  Mine came formatted for exFat.  Android will need it formatted in Fat 32.  To do this use the format function built into the phone.  After the format it works great!,Strongly Positive,Positive
If you are looking for a good SD card look no further. I use this in my Samsung Player and it works great. You can pop it in and out of multiple players if you want to give you flexibility. Also priced very good compared to other places.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"Like many here, mine failed and I lost my data (but being smart, I had a backup).  After further investigation, I found this product is NOT compatible with Android and a number of devices (cameras, phones, gps unit).  Windows seems to love it though.  Wish I had a windows device that could use 32G... my only one uses a whopping 100k at best.  What a Waste.UPDATE: Reformated is as FAT32 and works ok in my android devices and my Sony camera for about 3 months now.  Still, I keep a hot quick backup (OTA) every day to my desktop computer... I'll just say I'm not 100% confident in it yet.",Positive,Positive
"I got this for my brand new Nokia Lumia 810, but there is some kind of problem, the card is horribly slow, I can't record HD video to it, it studders.  I've tried reformatting several times to no avail.  I didn't have any of these problems with my old 32gb class 4 sandisk card...  There are other people having this problem as well, seems hit or miss.  I can't recommend this card at this time for this reason.EDIT:  I've contacted SanDisk and they are RMAing the card.  I'll improve the rating if the new card corrects the problem.EDIT: Got the new card, problem still exists...EDIT: I've suffered with this card for a year now, the only problem is that I cannot take video without studders, so I figured maybe software updates would eventually fix the problem.  They have not.  I have used multiple different camera apps, and the problem still persists.",Strongly Negative,Negative
"Works great with my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1.  Fast and dependable, no problem with viewing videos from it on the Note 10.1.  Try it you will like it!",Strongly Positive,Positive
Amazing price for this micro SD.  Brings adapter with it.  Class 10.  Great product. I am very happy with this purchase.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"I purchased this card on a daily lighting deal for my new Samsung Galaxy Note II. It was recognized without issues. I connected it with its adapter to my computer's card reader to transfer about 3Gb of data and the best consistent transfer rate (average) was roughly 13Mbps... That's less than %50 of the advertised transfer rate.To be fair, I've used the same external card reader with my Sony HX100 digital camera with an SD card (16Gb class 10) and I get double the transfer rate of what I've gotten for this card.Here is the setup:1- SD Adapter included with this card.2- External 12-in-1 USB 2.0 card reader connected to a USB 2.0 port on my PC3- Files transferred were of varying sizes.4- Transferred from 2TB Seagate X2 SATA3 HDD (connected to SATA2 port)5- Windows 8 Enterprise x64 (oh yah baby)The only excuse I give this card for its bad performance is the files were relatively small sizes but some of them were as large as 50Mb... This still does not justify the very low transfer rate.I am not really picky because this card will reside inside my super phone but still it does not justify the money paid for this card.I hope this will help others.",Negative,Negative
"I needed some new SD cards for my new tablets. After researching I bought the SanDisk ultra 32 GB MicroSDHC Class 10. It is way better than the almost same price SanDisk Ultra without Class10!! The Ultra Class10 is lightning fast. you can see the difference when you copy large files, you will note that read and write procedures are much faster, whether you use it in camera, smart phone or tablet. The price is also ok. Only drawback I noted was that the recognized capacity is not 32GB but 29,71GB in my Asus Memo Pad. Other than that I am extremly pleased with this Micro SD.",Positive,Positive
"using card in a Sony action cam,  records perfect, very happy with card and adapter.  no problems.  reads and writes good",Strongly Positive,Positive
"Can't beat the price and quality for the capacity. I always buy these chips from Amazon. SanDisk chips have worked well for me. No problems with read/right, no lost data.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"Really the gold standard.  I will reserve 5 stars until they blow me away on the price.  Otherwise, this is an excellent buy.",Positive,Positive
After purchasing several SDHC from other sources I was almost ready to give up.  Each of those was somehow defective.  The Amazon SDHC is genuine and works like a charm.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"I bought this to increase the storage in my smartphone.The Samsung Note came with 16GB, with about 12GB usable.Installed this to store movies for long trips.Holds about 10 full length compressed mp4 movies.",Neutral,Neutral
I never faced any issues ...so far..so good. It works well with my tablet. It is super fast and reliable.,Strongly Positive,Positive
Works as expected. Love the great price and use it with my GoPro3. I would definitely recommend this to everyone.,Strongly Positive,Positive
Very satisfied with the product and price.SanDisk has not let me down never and 32 Gb added to my Dell Venue 8 Pro tablet just rocks.I could have gone for the 64 Gb but I really don't need more than 32. And the price was right,Strongly Positive,Positive
I bought this as soon as I heard that Amazon and Best Buy were the only retailers carrying it (for the time being).It arrived promptly and worked with my Galaxy Note II flawlessly. I have been recommending purchasing these to customers at the store I work at regularly to try and get more people aware of the benefits of mass storage on small devices.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"I ordered a San Disk Ultra 32 GB and received it the next day via Prime. The only problem was that the card was defective. I went thru the process to return, which was simple, and did so. Received an email that a replacement had been sent with one day delivery. Got it today .Card is good, everything is perfect.I THANK YOU",Strongly Positive,Positive
"after doing some tests between a generic memory card and this sandisk i am very disappointed. i bought the 32 gig class (10) card.i swore i picked ""original packaging"" but it was shipped with out original packaging... i will be returning this card for the following reasons:these tests were done using the sd card ports on my pc.my generic class (6) 32 gig card has upload speed of 22MB (write) and a transfer speed of 8.5.my sandisk i just bought, it has an upload speed peaking at 32MB (write) and a transfer speed of 6.5 to maybe 8.5 if im lucky.the write speed is ok, but why is the transfer speed so much more low. why isnt it at least 10MB if not 12MB if sandisk is typically so modest in their classifications?and whats the deal with the no classification marking on this sd card... i dont see class (10) anywhere on this card....amazon you will be getting this back!",Negative,Negative
"First, it kept unmounting on the Galaxy Note 10.1I got it replaced.I used the replacement on my Galaxy S4 and it heats up my phone when charging. IT GETS VERY HOT. GS4 does not get hot with other sd cards. awaiting my second replacement.",Negative,Negative
"Bought it while it was one sale for $35.... I love itIt has given my Surface some wiggle room.Don't expect the read and write speed to be super fast. Most likely you computer doesn't support the current protocol to transfer at the Max speed.Overall Quality you expect from SanDisk though I think the price of this can come down bit more, now that the market is slowly moving away from microSD expansion aside from Samsung",Positive,Positive
"Purchased this card for use with my new SLR camera as a backup.  Read/Write to the card is fast which allows maximum use of special modes available with the camera. Data transfer speeds to a computer are also good, no real complaints.  Overall a good SD card for the price.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"The chip worked fine, fit perfectly, but it is SO TINY, if it falls out you are going to have a hard time finding it.If your application is a Tablet, or pad, if it has a &#34;push-in&#34; holder...you will want to put some tape, or other securing agent across the top of the chip and onto the Table sides.  If I had thought of it, clear finger nail polish would have worked just fine, or even a half drop of super glue on the top.I didn't, and it's forever gone now.  I changed from Android to Ipad and very satisfied that I upgraded to Apple.",Positive,Positive
Working flawlessly as it is supposed to.  I like the speed of the product.  The adapter case is also nice to have.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"this is my 3rd sandisk micro sd card for my 3rd android device, and just like its predecessors, the Ultra 64gb micro SDXC class 10 worked flawlessly in my SCH-I605 Samsung Galaxy Note 2.i simply inserted the card, power-cycled the device, and once rebooted, the Note 2 recognized an unformatted sd card and asked if i would like for it to be formatted in order to be read. once i chose YES, i now had an additional, fully usable micro sd card that i use for media and ebook reading storage.the response time is excellent, so i have no complaints on performance.i also love the fact that i ordered this at 3pm on Thanksgiving day when i was alerted of the $39.99 price tag.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"Used it in a Samsung Galaxy S3 and it was ruined within a month.  Second one I went through on that phone.  Contacted Verizon, Samsung, SanDisk, Google, and read a lot of forums.  Turns out a lot of people were having the issue with that phone and these cards.Of course the girlfriend threw away the card so I couldn't return it, so I don't know if the issue was fixed or if was a bad batch of cards that went out or what.  It's been a few months and I haven't seen the problem as much as before, so I can only assume it was a bad batch.I've had another card in my phone for a while and haven't had any issues, so for now I can't recommend this specific card unless their issue has been addressed.",Strongly Negative,Negative
"This thing works great. I have it to store pictures and videos and it works perfectly. I put it in and it formatted, and after that, no hassle at all. It was the best priced microsd here on Amazon and I am happy with the purchase. I would buy again if I needed to.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"Perfect.  Took card put old 32gb card and transferred it over to it in the computer.  (while my Samsung galaxy s5 was off).  Then inserted it in my Samsung galaxy s5, powered up and it was like I had never took the 32gb card out.  Read ringtones, programs stored on external sd card, everything - no errors, no glitches.  Connected the phone to the computer via usb cable and (usb 3 slot) and in no time my 75gb of music was transferred to my phone and it all read and is working perfectly.  I could not be more pleased when a products works like it is supposed to.",Strongly Positive,Positive
32GB Card takes my smartphone to a new level.  Recently purchased a RazrM and this huge capacity card allows me to take tons of picture even with a good percentage of my MP3 collection and about 9 movies on MP4.  Fast and so far so good as far as data integrity.  Highly recommend,Strongly Positive,Positive
"I packed everything that I wanted to use on my tablet onto this card and only took up about 25gb, but I haven't seen any delays in response times, whatsoever. It's very comforting to know that I have a massive amount of storage space available for downloads, pictures, videos, etc. Thank you to the manufacturer and seller for such an exceptional product and price.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"I already had a SanDisk 16GB Class 4 card in my Android phone. Here is how you know this is faster: I'd press the Play button for the music player with the Class 4 and there was always a small delay before the music played. With this 32GB SanDisk Ultra, the music plays immediately. This is a very useful way to tell how fast this is. This memory card gets my Approval and my Thanks to SanDisk!",Strongly Positive,Positive
Great price and great quality. It fit perfectly in my device. I highly recommend this brand. The adapter was a nice bonus.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"I've had this memory card for about 4 days. I ordered it with my new Galaxy S4 Verizon. Worked perfectly out of the box, didn't have to format, and read & write speeds meets up to my expectations. I will still keep my eyes on this card for little longer because I see some reviews reporting that cards fail after some time, but seems to be ok for me.Not relevant to this product, but I did get ONTRAC shipping(Amazon prime 2 day shipping) for this memory card and my Galaxy S4. After reading SO many negative reviews and feedback about this shipping company, I was crossing my fingers and hoping that they wouldn't do something stupid to my package. Fortunately, I got my package on time and nothing was damaged. One minor complain is that ONTRAC does not update their tracking history very often, or at all(based on my other purchases). As I was phoneless for couple days and really needed a phone, I checked the tracking history probably once every couple hours. It was showing that it has left the faculty for 2 1/2 days and was not updated at all until about an hour before I got my package saying that it went out for delivery on 9AM (I received my package around 5PM). Again, I got my package on time with no problem so I'm ok, but with the history of ONTRAC being so rubbish it just made me worry because I didn't wanted to be phoneless for 2-3 weeks.",Strongly Positive,Positive
Compatibility should not be an issue with these memory cards.  Even though they are SDHC they are very backwards compatible.  I threw a 32 gb in my phone for extra storage and I  have had no issues with it.  Make sure you move apps from your phone to your SD Card storage though.  It's future proof and you can hide important files on it if you want.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"Purchased this for my device, it worked as advertised. You can never have too much phone memory, since I download a lot of stuff this was a no brainer for me.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"Bought it with Retail Packaging, arrived legit, in a orange envelope, english version not asian like the picture shows. arrived quickly, bought a 32 and 16 both retail packaging for my htc one sv and Lg Optimus, both cards in working order, probably best price you'll get for a nice sd card",Strongly Positive,Positive
It's mini storage.  It doesn't do anything else and it's not supposed to.  I purchased it to add additional storage to my Microsoft Surface Pro tablet which only come in 64 and 128 GB.  It does what it's supposed to and SanDisk has a long standing reputation that speaks for itself.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"Works in a HTC Rezound.  Was running short of space on a 64GB Sandisk so I ordered this when it came out, fast and no issues.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"in my galaxy s4, super fast card, and am totally happy, not happy having to still type to fill the required words though",Strongly Positive,Positive
"It works, but file writes are a bit slower than expected on a USB3 reader. Also, both reads and writes are FASTER with the card inside the standard-size SD adapter on the same card reader.  Can't figure why...",Positive,Positive
"Solid SDHC card that is fast (at reading and writing) fast (for recording video and pics), has great capacity, and is reasonably priced. I have had no issues with it.Overall, highly recommend.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"I bought this to use with my go pro hero 3 black edition. It requires a class 10 MicroSDXC card. So far I've had no issues with it. Fast read/write, came with adapter, small packaging, but that's all it needed! Comes with a nice hard plastic case to keep both dry and together if needed.",Strongly Positive,Positive
Works as expected.  High transfer speed.  Nice to have extra microSD adapters lying around since I always seem to misplace them.  Mainly bought it to use in my Nikon DSLR since I can put the card directly into my (CM modded) Nook HD+ tablet in the field and view my images on a larger screen.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"Good price, works flawless in my Samsung S4! Normal SanDisk quality! That is why I go with this brand and only this brand..",Strongly Positive,Positive
San disk is hard to beat.  You will pay more for the brand but you get a quality product.  Would purchase again.,Strongly Positive,Positive
Installed in my Blackberry Q10 SQN100-1 and formatted. Works just fine. Plenty of storage space for pictures and videos of my son at the park.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"I just received my card, it is the class 10 64GB with the correct serial#SDSDQUA-064G-A11A. I received it in an unopened SanDisk packaging. I am going to use it on my HTC Rezound, I hope it works. From what I have read, it will work after reformatting the disk. I will update this review if I have any issues using it, if not, my rating will remain unchanged...",Strongly Positive,Positive
"I purchased two of these one for my Samsung tablet and one for my samsung galaxy note. Great hardware that is truly speedy, responsive and meets my needs!",Strongly Positive,Positive
The memory card is an excellent condition and work as described. Dependable and easy to use. An excellent choice for the enthusiast who requires more storage.,Strongly Positive,Positive
I've got a couple of these in varying sizes. I've had no problems and no complaints about speed. I always end up buying more because the prices are so low for what you get.,Strongly Positive,Positive
Bought it for my Surface Pro. I've had it in there for a few months and I've had no problems. Very fast and stable.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"Using this in a contout gps camera,  don't waste your time buying any other brand it will be a waste. Buy the best to start with.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"I've purchased several of these little babies over the years, and I always buy SanDisk. I've never had one fail, the price is great for the amount of storage you get.",Strongly Positive,Positive
It does the job and the price was right. It came quickly so I'm very happy for the purchase.  I would recommend it and would but it again.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"everything about it was great, except for the adapter.  It was so tight i had to use a tool to take it back out of the adapter causing me to chip it. so my fault i guess, but i also bought a 16gb version and the adapter for that one was fine.",Negative,Negative
Really you can't say anything bad about it. Does what it says. Super fast and great storage size for lots of movies and such.,Strongly Positive,Positive
This is just the standard micro SD card i would recommend this to anyone. i purchased this for my dad who is using it to expand the memory on his tablet! it shipped fast and is a slight bit cheaper than in the stores i believe.,Strongly Positive,Positive
Great Deal and much faster file movement.Definitely worth the purchase and sandisk has proved why they have good products.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"Use this in my Samsung Galaxy S4.  Have had it for almost a year now, no problems, really expands your memory capabilities, easy enough to install.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"excellent quality, excellent speed. no complaints here. very easy to use, reliable and the red stripe on the front makes it easy to find on a crowded desk",Strongly Positive,Positive
"This card advertises itself as UHS1 but it's actually UHS50.This means that it will not go up to SDR104 speeds/throughput.Not necessary bad, just false advertising.",Negative,Negative
"Purchase for HP tablet to have more memory for music download, pictures, and video.  Have enough room to store and some memory left over.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"Can there be anything wrong with a sandisk product?  the items read to it sooooo quickly, I am quite happy,",Strongly Positive,Positive
"fast transfer rates, I downloaded about 2GB of videos form the card to my laptop through a card reader, all in about a minute",Strongly Positive,Positive
"All though it states 16gig it only has 14.8gig available but I know that happens and expected it, keep this in mind if your wanting more storage you might want to order the 32gig card.  It was exactly what i expected and needed so no complaints.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"does the job as advertised.if you need extra memory on your phone/tablet or whatever device, this is bext buy(price/quality)",Strongly Positive,Positive
Needed for my cell phone - works perfectly.  SanDisk has never been a disappointment in the 30 plus years I've been in IT/computer work.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"Priced right, this memory card also reads and writes fast. It's a noticeable difference over cheaper cards. I put it in my phone and plan to buy another one for my tablet.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"Works great in the phone and the wife loves it, we got a second for her mom and she is storing lots of pictures and videos on it",Strongly Positive,Positive
I loaded this card up with home movies for my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2. The copy process from computer to card was fast. There are no skips in the movie quality and I have plenty of room left to go. Wish I had bought another for more collections.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"Bought this for my S3 and loaded it with 4 seasons of Futurama, 5 full length HD movies, several documentaries, and a dozen or so 30 minute comedy shows with plenty of room left over for pictures, etc...Only slight nitpick is when booting up into recovery mode on the S3 it will not recognize the card. Wanted to update the phone to the latest version of Android and it would not see it. Had to resort to a 2GB MicroSD I had laying around. That wasn't a SD card issue but I thought I would throw that in.",Positive,Positive
"Great storage, has not failed yet after about a year of usage.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"Since the wife is using it and it is not causing any problems, then it must be functioning normally. Looks good so far.",Strongly Positive,Positive
Class 10 speeds are the only way to fly and with 29.71GB of usable space I think I should be good for a while.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"The subject says it all.  Does what it's supposed to do ... at a great price.  When it's on sale, buy it.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"High speed, high capacity of storage. Great durability. I use in my phone and in my digital camera. Work very good",Strongly Positive,Positive
THis memory helps me to keep all what I want to keep on my cell phone.It is a good brand and its on the right price.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"I bought this SD card for my android phone thinking that a class 10 will be faster and more reliable than others. it turns out, the difference in class doesn't really matter at least for Android phones. didn't really worth the price difference",Negative,Negative
"Bought this to store music on my phone. Works flawlessly after three months so far, no problems.In my card reader, I average 6-8 megabytes read and write to it.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"Excellent, one of the best, can't go wrong with this card, class 10 is necessary and shows noticeable but not significant improvements over class 4",Strongly Positive,Positive
Got this to store movies and music on my Samsung Note III.Not much to say about a memory card except that it works as expected.,Strongly Positive,Positive
I purchased this version to expand memory on my 16gb android tablet.  Nothing fancy but it does the job.  No problems and it played back flawlessly all the files I transferred.There are so many different microSD cards out now but if you see this on sale then you might want to consider it instead of cheaper no-name brand.,Strongly Positive,Positive
I use this for my phone and it works just as it should and it was totally worth the money! Great place to store pictures and music for phones instead of using the phone memory so it will still run fast.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"I bought two of these one for Asus infinity and one for Samsung galaxy s3 international version. It worked fine with my Asus but it didn't work on my phone. I formatted this card using the phone,the tablet and my laptop  but didn't work I did some tests with apps using some apps nothing showed its not working the only way I got it to work is by formatting it in my Canon SLR camera.",Positive,Positive
Great for adding a ton of storage to your smartphone or other device.  Fast enough for most needs and the price is right.,Strongly Positive,Positive

"I bought this for a friend of mine to put some videos on it.  Initially, when plugged into the computer, we couldn't find the storage in the directory.  However, after finding a micro sd to usb adapter...bingo!  Worked like a charm after that.  Install the videos, plugged the card in the phone, and we were off to the races.Not sure if we needed the adapter, but we couldn't get the computer to recognize it.  We also used a Linux O/S.  Go figure.",Strongly Positive,Positive
I installed this on my Samsung tablet tab 2 7.0. There is definitely a performance difference on my tablet especially when i load up all my apps.,Strongly Positive,Positive
This memory works in Samsung Smartphones .It is a fast memorySandisk is the most reliable memories in the market,Strongly Positive,Positive

SanDisk is a company you can trust and offering such a good product at a low price.Comes with an adapter and small case to get full sd card size and keep it from getting lost when not in use.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"Appears to be Class 10, holds about as much as it says it does, came with an SD card adapter and they even gave me the option to forgo those ridiculous plastic packages that you all know and hate. The ones that the scissors refuse to cut and you just end up hurting yourself a few times before getting it open. Completely as advertised.",Strongly Positive,Positive
I bought this card for my Gopro hero3+ and it was worked fine. Some people said they have problems with the cards in the new gopros but I have had no such problems. The micro card works with anything that also takes standard cards due to the included adapter.,Strongly Positive,Positive
Have always had good experiences with SanDisk products.  This was priced well.  I have installed it in my wife's cell phone and it was immediately  recognized.

Used it in my Galaxy Note 2 for the past 16 months. All the sudden it is no longer writable. I tried many ways to reformat the card.

"Got this because you can't beat the price and Sandisk has so far always been reliable for me.  I own two 32gb UHS-1 cards and a few older (16gb, 8gb, class 4, class 6, etc) Sandisk MicroSDs not including my standard SDs or my USB thumb drives and they have stood up to my tests with only one card I can think of failing, which I was still able to recover all the data from (just not write to it anymore) and I'm pretty hard on my rewritable media.  What more can you say?",Strongly Positive,Positive
"Cannot go wrong with SanDisk and to date it works as advertised. The price wasn't a great cost savings but because it came from Amazon which has a great reputation to date as far as I am concerned, I purchased through them.",Positive,Positive

"does exactly what I needed it to do for Galaxy S5. Word of Warning...With KitKat it prevents apps from editing, changing, deleting anything on your SD card. Stock Apps that come with the phone can but downloaded ones are not able to. The trick if you have pics movies or whatever is to copy them to the Phones Internal Storage and delete from there. Until they fix it or come up with a non root work around for the Operating System.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"Worked great in my galaxy s4--until it didn't work at all for some unknown reason. Used it for about 4 months before it crapped out. BACK UP YOUR DATA WITH ALL THESE THINGS, THOUGH....",Negative,Negative

"I routinely use SDXC cards up to 128GB, and this card was unreadable on arrival.  Both of my PCs said it needed to be formatted, and as a last resort I let one of them try (Windows 7/i7with up-to-date SDXC drivers), and it could not format it.  It's on its way back to Amazon.  I'm glad their returns are so easy!",Negative,Negative

As usual anything from San Dish is a quality product.  Bought to use with my Surface Pro.  Works as described and fast connection.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"Bought this for my wife's Samsung TL240, which kept locking up with a lesser speed SD card. After throwing this card in there, the camera rarely locks up when taking pictures back-to-back. If you are shooting 10+ MP and taking pictures back-to-back or shooting HD vid, it's a good idea to upgrade to a Class 10 card.",Strongly Positive,Positive

Can't go wrong with this class 10 card cheap and works great may have to buy another one as a spare.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"Fast, reliable, plenty of size for the money. I ran Sandisk memory zone on this and was reading between 22 and 29 mbps. Not quite the 30 that it is supposedly rated at, but that is with a lot of apps installed and running off of the device.",Strongly Positive,Positive

Had not malfunctioned throughout many different uses and I trust this brand. Although it is more expensive as supposed to other brands, but they are worth extra in my opinion.",Strongly Positive,Positive
I have a lot of music and pictures and keeping them on the card frees up storage for apps that cannot use the card.  Money well spent.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"I have always trusted the SANDISK brand for valuable data.  This was ordered for my tablet and again, great size and quality for the price.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"I have a Samsung Note II and was on the verge of having to uninstall programs when the newest version of Android came out which allowed you to move applications to the external storage.After reading the reviews I purchased this card to replace my 4G card, now I have room for all my pictures videos and tons of apps. The performance is really great from what I can tell , the pictures , videos and apps load quickly and I have not had any issues with this at all.A must have to extend your Android storage.",Strongly Positive,Positive
I have this in a DROID X on Page Plus.  It works perfectly.  transfer speeds were good.  I have no complaints here.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"I have used many memory devices from SanDisk, as well as a couple of Sansa MP3 players. This card lives up to my expectations. It works well in my Samsung Galaxy S3 phone.

I want to be sure my photos and other data are held in a safe place.  For the money, you cannot beat this product and I will buy again.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"In some situations, depending on what hardware you intend to use this card in you'll need to format it in a special way using a formatting utility that doesn't come native to windows.  Also, the card gets extremely hot under heavy load.",Neutral,Neutral

"it is an almost required piece for my Samsung tablet.  it was at a good buy. :-)it is easy to use, and easy to install.",Strongly Positive,Positive
it's a class 10 so it's pretty fast.  I am using it in my HTC EVO LTE 4G phone hoping that it had UHS-1 capability.  It doesnt seem to so it's just a class 10.,Strongly Positive,Positive
I use this in my Galaxy Note 3 and seems to work just fine.  I love having lots of memory and the price was good.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"I use this in my Samsung Galaxy Note II. For the money, it's a fantastic value. I haven't noticed any transfer speed issues, and it's been rock-solid reliable for the 3 months I've owned it. I have about 32GB of music stored on it, and every app that can use SD card storage is set to do so, including all my system backups. The ultimate &#34;install and forget&#34; add-on for your phone!",Strongly Positive,Positive
"I've purchased this MicroSD card back in January for use in my tablet and my Android smartphone.  I've used this card extensively to transfer music and files and I've found it's rather interchangeable and versatile across a number of surfaces.  The card hasn't corrupted itself or become unusable at any point so I figure, for the value, that's pretty much what I want.  And 32 GB covers the amount of storage I would want for my mobile devices.",Strongly Positive,Positive
I've used this card for about 3 months now and have not had a bit of trouble.  I notice to delay while the phone writes to the memory after taking pictures or shooting full HD video.,Strongly Positive,Positive
Just what I needed for my digital music collection on my phone.,Strongly Positive,Positive
Memory either works or not what more can be said than it works as designed.  I was very happy with the price.,Strongly Positive,Positive

"No complaints.  Worked in every piece of electronics I've tried them in.  I've run across fake chips online before, but these are high quality at a good price.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"Not as fast as advertised most of the time, actually slowed down my Note 3 when I filled it with movies leaving only about 8gb free, switched to a faster card due to that, but it could also be the phones fault. All in all it's a good card with good speed and size for the money.",Positive,Positive
Product supplied as described: 16GB Micro SDHC Class 10 card with Adapter. I purchased this to use in my Samsung Galaxy Tablet and it works perfectly. It is easy to identify from other micro flash cards you may have because of its red/grey color. This is a great memory solution for your stored media for any device!,Strongly Positive,Positive
"Product works as advertised. No issues with install or general use in my mobile phone. It doesn't seem particularly snappy, but that may be more the phone than anything else.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"So I'm not going to pretend to be an expert on sd cards, but I still like this one. It is relatively inexpensive, works wonderfully for the movies I want to store and watch on my samsung galaxy tab 7 2.0, and I haven't had a single problem with storage yet.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"Still working with no problems so far, so it seems to be reliable. Not sure what else to say, but they want more words.",Strongly Positive,Positive
The card arrived promptly and has worked flawlessly in a dashcam. Would recommend purchase to others if they need this kind of card.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"The card looks good, works fine, I didn't do too much test with it.My only complaint until now is the package, there's a line marked on the back for you to cut, I cut along the line, and nothing happened, no opening at all, all cardboard glued tightly. so I cut near the card, only to found I cut the supposed plastic card case/storage shell, now I took it out, and no storage case to store. Not a functional problem, but annoying.",Negative,Negative
The SanDisk Ultra 16GB memory card has shown no sign of not being exactly what I needed.  A good deal.,Strongly Positive,Positive

This is the biggest memory card I have at 32 gig.  It works fine!  I am using it on an 8 inch Dell tablet with Windows 8 and a solid state 8 gig hard drive.,Strongly Positive,Positive
This is the second one of these SanDisk 32 GB MicroSDHC cards I have bought.  One I installed in my Samsung Galaxy S3 and this one I installed in my Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 - 8.0.  These are excellent options for both devices to expand storage.  One of the reasons I went with Samsung products is because you can use MicroSD cards unlike Apple iPhone products where you can't.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"This provides plenty of storage capacity for your tablet and mobile devices - I've put this into all my cellphones and Android tablets. After twelve months of use, downloading music, videos, apps - there is plenty of room left.The class 10 version is also great for phone/tablet cameras as well for a stand alone camera (yes I still use a digital camera - so yesterday). This is a must for HD action video camera/recorder as well. The price continues to drop so it is very affordable now - unless your device can take the 64Gb version - I'd go with the higher capacity for video recording devices.",Strongly Positive,Positive
This was the perfect addition to my Surface tablet.  It came in easy to open packaging and it worked from the moment I pout it in the Microsoft Surface tablet.  Expanded my 32 g tablet to a lot more storage for movies and music.,Strongly Positive,Positive

We bought this to go with our new Samsung Galaxy Tab 4. Works great and allows us to add a lot of videos onto our tablet.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"We use these for our Samsung Galaxy 4s phones and they are amazing because I can now take a gazillion pictures! I only wish that I could separate the pictures on the memory card into folders but that is a Samsung issue, not the memory card issue.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"What is there to say about a sd card. It works, and it's a class 10 card. The price was decent. I needed one for my android tablet, shopped around and this one seemed like the best choice.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"What more can you ask for ?  No errors ever detected by Android OS, and having this unit plugged into my tablet means I'm never without data or pictures that I want.",Strongly Positive,Positive
Worked fine in my Samsung S4 for one year.  Then it stopped allowing writing to the card.  Would not format even on a PC or with another device.  The data is still there but cannot be erased.,Strongly Negative,Negative
Worked with my Samsung Galaxy S3 perfectly. I finally have the space to take all my current digital content with me when I am on a plane.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"Works fine in my Sony RX100 using the provided adapter, but who would expect otherwise.  Bought the more expensive micro with adapter rather than full size SD so that I can move it to other devices that take micro SD.Prime shipping arrived in one day.",Strongly Positive,Positive
Would not work in my Samsung Galaxt Tab 2 7.0 3G that I purchased it for.  But it does work fine in my Asus TF700. So I swapped the cards between them and everythings's OK.  First time I've seen this with a Sandisk product.,Positive,Positive
Got this for the Dell Venue 8 Pro and it works perfectly. No complaints. Here are more words to complete my review.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"I bought this the day it came out for the great price of $119.99 and it finally showed up a month later. (I knew this going in). I put it in my Galaxy note 3 and it instantly recognized it and I was set.Speeds in my laptop via the included adapter ranged from 15-30mb read speed and about 12mb write speed. I copied an entire 64 GB card over to this one, and it took some time, but now I have double the space.",Strongly Positive,Positive
I confirm this works for my note on CM10 nightly. however it did not work upon arrival. It had to be re-formatted into FAT32. I used a small program fat32format through Google. I believe other programs would work too.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"If storage is what you need for your tablet, then this is pretty much a no brainer as long as it supports it :) Would recommend if you have a Galaxy Note 10.1",Strongly Positive,Positive
"I have this regularly plugged into my ASUS Transformer TF300T tablet as extra storage. But with the included adapter I can also plug it into my laptop. So I use it as a sort of &#34;sneaker-net&#34;, allowing me to move 30 GB of data to what ever I am using at the time. It is filled mostly with pictures and movies. The speed of this makes it convenient for transferring large amounts of data. I'll be buying another one of these in the near future.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"SanDisk continues its legacy with this high-speed microHD card. A definite must for your tablet or smartphone, provided it accepts external memory cards. Then again, why would you buy one that doesn't?",Strongly Positive,Positive

I love this 64 GB microSD.  I dont ever have to think about it now.  I love that we can get such a large amount of memory for our devices.,Strongly Positive,Positive
All the horror stories about SD memory not really being the density reported.  I loaded two of these things to the max.  All data is accessible.,Strongly Positive,Positive
It's worked great with my Galaxy S4 cell phone. Videos and photos taken with the phone automatically get stored to the memory card after it was installed as do may apps.  No issues.,Strongly Positive,Positive
Great card for a great price read and write speeds are on par with what is posted on the specifications detail report.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"Gave to my Samsung galaxy note 10.1 the power to take and use it with any kind of application. Quick, easy, install and play.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"So far so good. I've never noticed a difference in memory cards, I'm just very glad to have extra memory!",Strongly Positive,Positive
I replaced a 64GB card in my note 3 with this 128GB card and everything seems to be working just fine as expected.  I've been using the card for about a week.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"I have been amazed at memory pricing, but this little card is inexpensive, fast and just what I needed for my new tablet.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"Be aware--if you want to use this device to record and play high-definition video with files greater than 4gb, you'll need to format the card as exFAT or NTFS (if you want to play the files on either a PC or a Mac. But it works well after properly formatting.",Positive,Positive
Amazon sells this card for a great value! No local store even comes close to this price. It has plenty of room on it for lots of storage.,Strongly Positive,Positive
These cards work well with many of our pieces of electronic equipment when we travel.  The price was perfect and none failed. They also worked with the readers we had.,Strongly Positive,Positive

"Memory cards are almost commodity items now, but I still prefer name brands with 5+ year warranties.  Had a problem with a Sandisk a while back, and they replaced it under warranty without any hassle.",Strongly Positive,Positive
I have two of these and use them for my Galazy Note 2. It's great having the flexibility to keep extra storage with you for your 'phablet'.So far they have done what they are intended to do.,Positive,Positive

"I just popped it in my Sony Xperia Tablet Z .  It works.  There is no sense that I will ever run out of room.  If I was using it for work that might be different, but I could just change with a new micro sd card.  I don't know why all tablets don't have a port for one.  I feel confident with the SanDisk brand.  I have never bought a bad SanDisk product.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"I just bought two of these for our two new Samsung Galaxy IV smart phones.  The adapters will make it possible for the card readers on our computers to accept these MicroSD cards if we find it worthwhile to pull them out of the phone case rather than use the USB &#34;dongle&#34; to move information on and off the phones, but.. most importantly, now I don't worry about storing audio books, favorite playlists, and video clips I might want to show someone on the phones.",Strongly Positive,Positive
"Card is Good. I ordered one before and it performs as one would expect, so I ordered another. It took much longer to attempt get the second one so I wrote and got a refund. Seller, NMicro Technology,  was not the same as the first.",Negative,Negative
"the unit shows 0 bytes, in a PC or the phone. it keeps dismounting also. I got a replacement and it did the same thing. Not sure what is going on but it looks like a Chinese counterfeit case. I have seen this happen more and more lately. Amazon seems to be a major portal for these hings, it makes sense with a such a large retailer, they cant check everything.",Strongly Negative,Negative
"I do not get the advertised speed of 30MB/s, more like a 200-300KB/s on my Galaxy S4. At least it gives me a lot of extra storage space, for a phone it works nicely if you don't need to transfer big files.",Neutral,Neutral
I own MULTIPLE of these cards for my phones and devices and haven't ever had a problem.  Would buy again if I ever needed one for another device.,Strongly Positive,Positive
"had it in my samsung tablet and it went bad after 2 months, wont let me reformat or read it or do anything with it. money down the drain.",Strongly Negative,Negative

"I got this to upgrade my surface pro 2's storage and it works nicely, what do I store on it? Bunch of MP3's and games on steam.It works well, the games run fine, boot pretty quick, the one issues I had was installing the games, sometimes the card would vanish from the drive and I'd have to pop it in and out to get it to go again, however I feel like that could be software related as nothing like that happened while playing a game.Best idea is to install the game on the surface, move the files over manually to the card, &#34;tell steam to uninstall the game&#34; to erase it from the list, then hit install, point it to the folder on the card, then it'll spot the files, download only a few things and bam, it works.About the card itself, I wouldn't rely on multitasking off this thing, as it's not meant for that- as in if you're playing music off this card, do not install a game at the same time.
